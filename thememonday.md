### What?

\#ThemeMonday on App.net has a simple premise; a group of like-minded people change their avatars on or around the second Monday of every month, to a theme chosen by them after shortlisting and then a vote.

### ThemeMonday for the Monday:

**2016 January 11:**

[x] The call to vote: [here.](http://bazbt3.github.io/2016/01/04/thememonday-call/)

[â€¦] The people's suggestions, ongoing here:

* \#RandomMonday - @cn    
* \#OfficeMonday - @blumenkraft
* \#HappierMondays - @mcdemarco
* \#ComicsMonday - @cano
* \#StarWarsMonday - @ronnie

Before it gets unwieldy for the vote, should we cap the list at a predetermined number??  Let me know!  In any event, @polls tops out at 10 entries.

[ ] The vote: here.

[ ] The result: here!
