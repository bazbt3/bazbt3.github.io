### What is \#ThemeMonday?
[**\#ThemeMonday**](https://pnut.io/tags/ThemeMonday) *(live hashtag at pnut.io)* has a simple premise; a group of like-minded people change their avatars on or around the second Monday of every month, to a theme chosen by them after shortlisting and then a vote.

### Approximate timeline, rule:
(Starting a week prior.)

1. Weekend: Ask for suggestions,
2. Thursday evening: Create poll,
3. Saturday evening/Sunday morning: Announce result!

* In the event of a tiebreaker being necessary @bazbt3 will roll a die.

## History:
* Originally proposed by @alicia and ably implemented and run by @berklee, [\#ThemeMonday](http://bazbt3.github.io/thememonday/) *(an ADN Wiki page)* was indisputably App.net's most popular regular event.  @bazbt3 took over from @berklee and ran it for a while.  App.net closed down on March 16 2017 so most links below will cease to work, but the memories of all participants will undoubtedly remain with them forever.
* In the event of a tiebreaker being necessary, @bazbt3 previously sent a PM to @mlv's [Eliza_Bot](https://alpha.app.net/eliza_bot) asking her to `roll 1dn` (where `n` was the number of tying choices.)
