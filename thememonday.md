### What?

[\#ThemeMonday](https://alpha.app.net/hashtags/thememonday) (live hashtag) on App.net has a simple premise; a group of like-minded people change their avatars on or around the second Monday of every month, to a theme chosen by them after shortlisting and then a vote.

Before it gets unwieldy for the vote, should we cap the list at a predetermined number in the future??  Let me know!  In any event, @polls tops out at 10 entries.
