**A short guide for those intimidated by Facebook.**

You might want to check your settings to ensure anything you post is kept within your circle of 'Friends'.  Let's face it, when you win the Lottery (because you *will*) and you're milking the company sickness schemne while you're still figuring out whether to retire early, it might not go down too well when your boss finds the raucous party/extreme ironing/nude parascending/cage-less shark taming pics.

Vetting people you decide to become 'Friends' with is paramount; you wouldn't like the one you didn't invite to the extreme ironing event to show the big bad boss the event post you marked as 'Friends only', would you.

To 'Like' (this used to be a simple 'thumbs-up') a friend's post it's quite unacceptable to employ the icon with the big laugh and tears rolling down the face to show sympathy at the loss of a beloved pet, relative or football game; especially when the poster adds "*LOL*" at the end of every related sentence.  It's for them to determine whether laughing out loud at the loss of a limb it acceptable.  If in doubt and you must engage without using words, use the 'thumbs-up' like, it's potentially the least offensive.

To reply to a friend's post type something in the 'Write a comment' box below their post.

To see others' replies to a friend's post, press '(n) comments(s)'.

To reply to a reply to a friend's post, press 'Reply' below the reply to the friend's post.

Not at all confusing is it.

Your friends and their friends will often post absolute nonsense, which your friends will share to be sociable, but Snopes cannot usually be used to check what they're been eating, drinking, and where.  You should visit [Snopes.com](https://www.snopes.com/) for fact checking events or stories vaguely related to domestic of world events.  Bearing in mind it's a US site with a bias towards that country, it's nonetheless *useful* for the big stuff.
