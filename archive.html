<p>
  I write for myself; what started out as a journal became an archive of my blog posts. Doesn't that sound grandâ€½
</p>

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <h3>
        <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
      </h3>
      {{ post.excerpt }}
      <span class="post-date">{{ post.date | date_to_long_string }}</span>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
