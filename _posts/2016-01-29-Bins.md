My wife had gone to work, I'd sent the girls upstairs to get ready for bed *and clean their teeth*, the cats and dog were fed.  At a temporary loose end, the desire to create another podcast had simply grown too strong; I had to…

The answer, the inspiration, came from an unexpected source.  Have a listen.

Why?

Because I can.  It's not a podcast, for I am still not a podcaster.
