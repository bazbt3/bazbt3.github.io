As my youngest daughter started to read one of her homework reading assignment books, 'Amazing Whales', I have to admit I struggled mightily attempting descriptions before she got the book's *true* facts.

It's something we attempt every reading session; try to guess, then read, then debrief.

This time though one word in particular made me pause…

…and, silently, admit defeat.

* Easy to describe: Dolphin; Killer, Blue, Grey…
* Intermediate: Baleen, Beluga… 
* Hard: *Sperm*…

Luckily my wife was out walking Ruby dog, otherwise it could have got *rather* messy.

In other news, Bob The Builder seems to have had a makeover for 2016.

Sacrilege!
