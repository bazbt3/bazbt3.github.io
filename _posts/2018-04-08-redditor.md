I'm using Reddit again and, *in some respects*, again regretting it.  Not the small number of negative comments my leading question in r/Browns (the Cleveland Browns NFL subreddit) inspired, no; it's the *capriciousness* of users' up- and down-voting, where incomplete answers and sarcastic comments gain more 'positivity' thanâ€¦

Oh, look here:

[HELP Its been a while since I used solidworks and I forgot how to read and use the hole callout to create a threaded hole.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidWorks/comments/8akdq2/help_its_been_a_while_since_i_used_solidworks_and/?st=JFQM3YVO&sh=b4e02a9c)

Or (shrugs) don't look there.  My answer was genuinely useful and pretty-much complete, the original poster (OP) even thanked me.

Has it put me off in the same way recent unwarranted post deletions at Fark.com actually *have*?

No, it's the nature of the beast that is Reddit.
