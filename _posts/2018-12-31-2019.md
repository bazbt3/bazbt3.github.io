Thanks, whatever you did that brightened any of my 2018.

I resolve to do these things:

* Build on the successes from this year's no nail biting and whatever the other one was (not memory-related!),
* Lose the weight I didn't this year (I'm +6lbs on this last day of the year, i.e. with 1-1/2 hours left in it to lose 27lbs),
* Exercise (see above) including walking Ruby dog more,
* Drink more (I turned into a lightweight again),
* Be more assertive with my girls' schools and the people tasked with looking after their unique needs,
* Be less in thrall to my girls; a teeny bit controversial.

See you in 365 days!
