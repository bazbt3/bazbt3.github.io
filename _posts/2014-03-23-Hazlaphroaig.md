title: 'I Haz Laphroaig'
---

This morning I badly needed a decongestant, so the timing of the gift could not have been more appropriate.  Purists (and those who abhor the practise, however infrequent, of drinking alcohol before 10am) look away nowâ€¦
 
I had it with hot water, maple syrup (the squeezy bottle of honey had solidified due to lack of recent usage,) sugar and a few drops of lemon juice (yup, Jif, from a bright yellow squeezy plastic bottle.)

And it was lovely.  Please disregard the fact that I'm currently sat here with Earex drops in both ears to hopefully clear the temporary deafness, and both ears are plugged with toilet paper (there's no cotton wool in the house.)

Laphroaig is a fantastic drink.  It takes time. It's best approached along a long and winding path. I confess I worked my way up through a lot of the blended Scotches, through the easy-on-the-palate single malts, and thought Talisker was the pinnacle of Scots' liquid refreshment achievement, until I found Laphroaig.  I'm not a drinker, it took a *serious* amount of time.

Incidentally, my previous Scottish pinnacle, 'Irn Bru' has now, though marginally, been beaten into third place.

The best summary I've heard of Laphroaig so far from a drinker of blended whiskies: "Ugh, it tastes like medicine!"  *Medicine?* That works for me, and has in the past been an often-used excuse^H^H^H^H^H^Hreason for getting the glass out.  Forget Cask Strength and other marketing ploys designed to extract the unwary buyer's money... The best Laphroaig by a long distance was the 15-year-old, now sadly not marketed.

I was introduced to it (thanks 'Bob' the builder) on a cruise down the Nile.  Transported in so many ways to a more relaxed world (for society's elite of course) and broad as the following statement is, I really cannot think of any combination of 2 things that, when combined, are more redolent of the luxury I imagine existed in the bygone age visitors to Egypt expect to encounter.
