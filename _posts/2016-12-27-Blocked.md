I made and uploaded a second video to YouTube!  20 seconds long, I guarantee it will not change your life.

A scroll down memory lane, it's all the Twitter accounts I've blocked in the nearly 6 years I've had the account.  I started to delete a few of the first, hit the Twitter rate limit, and then simply gave up.

Incidentally, at first playback it started off as low-resolution (144p) on my phone.  It goes all the way to 11 (720p) for the more curious.
