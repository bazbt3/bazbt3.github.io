Talking Heads have had a major influence in my life.  Subtle but major nonetheless.  I'm now accustomed to the fact I'll never see them play live; it's taken me decades…

Prior to App.net's shut down for good I'd hoped a song could be played during the final #MondayNightDanceParty.  Due to an unfortunate typo by yours truly that didn't happen.  No matter, it's this:

It sums up what I think of ADN.  Especially poignant is… oh, listen to it!

Tidying up my emotions after ADN's termination, here's a song which looks forward:
