title: 'NOW!'
---

It's 8:10pm.\*

A couple of days ago I installed an application program on this thing in my hand.  A thing, if not of beauty, then a 4.6 inches (diagonal) thing of awesomeness.

I opened the application program and searched across the wired *and* wire-less networks untilâ€¦ I found what I was searching for.

And then, then it got a *little* complicated.

'Amazon Prime Now' could deliver a thing I want between 10pm and midnight.

To my home.

Today.

A thing I want at a price I can afford, a price which is reasonable given market forces; but yet a price I simply cannot justify before (or after) payday.

It's a thing I've been waiting for all my adult life: on-demand music, movies, TV, cat litter, towels, chocolates, ski accessories, and something we already have; yes, food.

(sighs)

Got it all and yet I must still find *something* to complain about.

\*It was.
