title: '300 posts?'
---

As someone who uses a blog to write to work through *issues* I must appear to the world to be a seething mess of discontentment, finding Schadenfreude in the news, no solace from the issues confronting our world.

Checking through the *nearly*-300 posts at the [GitHub Pages repository](https://github.com/bazbt3/bazbt3.github.io), some of which I've deemed unsuitable to resurrect at 10Centuries (actually uninteresting even to me!), I found a couple where I profess to be not a blogger.

I very rarely check my post view/feed access count page, have never thought of monetising it all (for reasons anyone who's ever read my stuff will know) so why do I write?  To get things off my chest in the hopes of achieving a catharsis, inner peace…

Nearly 300 posts, probably a few more if counting the WordPress precursor, predecessor, whatever the word is…

Hmmm…

I should compile a 'best of' list, as ageing rock stars do.
