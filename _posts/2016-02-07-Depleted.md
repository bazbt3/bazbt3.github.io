Not exactly a perfect storm of events, not by any means; nevertheless, we ran out of:

* Dog food,
* Dog treats,
* Cat treats,
* Carpet urine absorber powder,
* Dog toys even *vaguely* resembling their initial, as-purchased, state.

It's Ruby Dog's first birthday on Wednesday; a visit to the pet superstore is perhaps in order.

This, though I might refer to it in the store, is not a shopping list.
