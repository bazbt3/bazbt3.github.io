Finally, we have liftoff!  A week-and-a-half in, and I've managed to configure a Â£30 computer *and* create a functional pair of shell scripts to post blithering idiocy to my test site/blog.

Streamlining it all to improve security, to post only changed files within the site, and to have the computer run connected only to power & the local network are my next goals.

Achievable.
