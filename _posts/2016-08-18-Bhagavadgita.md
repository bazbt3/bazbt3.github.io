> "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."

Robert Oppenheimer, widely known as 'the father of the atomic bomb' said these words around 20 years after the 2 nuclear weapons detonated over Japan.

Ah, it's a powerful, evocative phrase alright, but one holding within a small mistranslation of a small section of the Bhagavad Gita.  Nevertheless I'm allowing it; the man did translate it himself.  From the Sanskrit.*

This evening I feel bad, something of a pale shadow of the man.  Clearing some long grass in the Turner Estate's Lower Field (despite knowing it'll adversely affect the drainage) I disturbed a small frog.

Now it must be said, I carried on clearing the growth and disturbed another small frog.  Then another.  Three unique frogs, with one thing in commonâ€¦

Today a human, the same human who'd previously followed their lives to flourish undisturbed, arrived with a big chopper and casually destroyed their habitat.
