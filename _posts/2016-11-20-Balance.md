It's fair to say that 2016 has been a bit of a shocker for most, both in celebrity deaths and in the confounding of many's preconceived ideas of normality.

In the main I follow like-minded social media accounts.  Ok, like-minded people.  But there's a downside: my views are confirmed in by those from whom I take my barometric measurements.

I've decided that, to ensure I'm better-prepared for the nasty surprises (and those nasties I'm EXPECTING!) during 2017, I shall look outside my comfort zone.  Proven psychic ability, especially in the arena of celebrity death precondition, I've an open mind about.

If you understand and you've any recommendations I'm all ears.

Equilibrium, please.
