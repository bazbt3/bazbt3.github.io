After breakfast today the girls and I went to the cinema; we watched 'Storks' and I cried at the end.

I got involved with the characters, had my sense of disbelief well-and-truly suspended, so yes, of course I cried.  I cry at every children's movie we go to see.  Whilst I can't remember crying at 'Cars' there's every possibility I did.

Thus, the movie 'Storks' easily gains Baz's Seal of Approval.
