Another Super Bowl (50, [not 'L'](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000355943/article/nfl-wont-use-roman-numerals-for-super-bowl-50)) over, the serious business of me choosing a team begins.

I was a fan of the San Francisco 49ers when they won it all a couple of times (plus the talk of a 'threepeat'), followed the rebirth and ascendancy of the Jones' Dallas Cowboys, and then, thenâ€¦ went off the boil a bit.

I still watched the games with friends, went to see the Scottish Claymores in the NFL Europe league, even participated in a peripheral manner in helping out an amateur youth team.  And helped out with a fanzine.

2004 brought a trip to Ohio, to see the Wauseon high school team, the Bowling Green college team, and the Cleveland Browns play.  An *amazing* weekend.  And the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

And then bang; I got married, we had children, and my hobby time evaporated somehow.

So, which team?

Should I:

* Invent a sophisticated analytical technique to determine which now utterly crap team stands the highest likelihood of rising fastest?
* Work within the confines of my history?
* Pick the newest (and at the same time [one of the oldest](http://www.therichest.com/sports/football-sports/top-10-oldest-nfl-teams/?view=all)) franchise - the Los Angeles Rams?

Maybe I should throw all the team names into a hat.  One that Ruby dog hasn't chomped yet.
