We have an [Amazon Echo Dot.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Echo-Dot-Generation-Black/dp/B01DFKBG5Y?th=1&psc=1)  It's touted as a voice-controlled electronic assistant.  It's more than that: can stream music, create todo and shopping lists, play rudimentary games, control heating, lights - and all at the sound of one's voice.  It's, and I hesitated to use the word but shall anyway, a *neat* gadget, and one that works really really well.

I've already posted the following to Twitter and Facebook: with a parental advisory to not trust a small child with an Amazon Echo/Dot. Ever!  Such is the ephemeral nature of social networks though that I thought it best to commit this *particular* memory to my blog.  For posterity.

Here is the video.  You'll need the sound on.  Funny, definitely and gloriously NSFW*:
