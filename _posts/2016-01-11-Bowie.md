David Bowie is no longer with us.

Astronaut Chris Hadfield posted a [fitting tweet,](https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/status/686515079869771776) and here's his quote from the BBC's [reaction page:](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/entertainment-arts-35278886)

> "I was so sad to wake up this morning to the news ... The whole span of my adult life I've been listening to David Bowie so it is an irretrievable loss. It saddens me. I'm just delighted I got to play a little part in everything he's done."

I felt the same way, though it's easy to say it *now.*  I will admit to owning only a small part of his catalogue, and playing even that infrequently; butâ€¦

Thanks for the music, the memories.
