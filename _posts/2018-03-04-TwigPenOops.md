title: 'TwigPen oops'

Oops! I forgot to `git pull origin master` the updated script from the [rssupdatepnut GitHub repo.](https://github.com/bazbt3/rssupdatepnut)

Here's the blog post announcing my tweeted notification of new blog posts: [http://bazbt3.10centuries.org/2018/03/04/twigpen](http://bazbt3.10centuries.org/2018/03/04/twigpen).

Daft Baz scratched head for a few minutes thinking the script'd failed for some techy reason.  No, simply PEBKAC.

Am I feeling lucky?
