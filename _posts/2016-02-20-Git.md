A short one today.  My nearly-week-old Raspberry Pi is now behaving, more-or-less.\*  Here's a link to what I wanted to do, what I've done, and what I've actually accomplished so far.

[My Raspberry Pi Setup](https://github.com/bazbt3/raspberry_pi_setup) - at GitHub.com.

It's not overly-technical, nor is it particularly helpful or comprehensive.  The plan is to expand a bit, make it more readable.

There are spelling errors sprinkled throughout, and it's an early draft.
