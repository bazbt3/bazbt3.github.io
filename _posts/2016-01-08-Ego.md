I have a new redirect from my vanity domain.  The general structure, as of today, is:

* [(www.)bt3.com](http://www.bt3.com) - a Mediawiki site, 'self-hosted' on a server provided by @rabryst (App.net.)  Currently stagnant, I'm unable to take it down without a tortuous examination of the action's impact on the rest of the Web,\*
* [blog.bt3.com](http://blog.bt3.com) - a subdomain redirecting to bazbt3.re-app.net, my blog hosted at 10centuries.com by @matigo (App.net),
* [ego.bt3.com](http://ego.bt3.com) - the new subdomain redirecting to bazbt3.github.io, my test blog hosted by Github.com.

Why 'ego'?

My first choice, 'id', would have misrepresented the blog a little; there's nothing visceral allowed to intrude, though my aim *is* to introduce its reader to the writer.

I'd toyed with the idea of something 'clever' but difficult to verbally pass on, for example 'httpcolonslashdot', 'http', or simply 'dot'; but the likelihood that my site will be disseminated by literal word-of-mouth is remote indeed.

So, because I have one, 'ego' it is.

Don't bookmark it.
