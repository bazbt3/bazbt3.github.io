After a weekend of comparative misery, earlier this morning I sent a text message to my wife.  It read thus:

> "Sorry I didn't finish off putting stuff away earlier, I had to go upstairs and have the mother of all poos in the en-suite. It felt *so* much better afterwards.  How was the trip to school? :)"

How posh is thatâ€½
