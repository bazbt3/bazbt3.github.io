Sod it, I'll add a drink to the food order; the tablets say I can have a drink!

Woodford Reserve rye whiskey.

There is no contraindication so don't worry, but I doubt the manufacturer would want to encourage irresponsible behaviour.  No, in answer to the question I sense forming, the tablets *don't* talk to me, that'd be a bit weird.
