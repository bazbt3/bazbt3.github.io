title: 'Birthday customs'

I had a birthday recently.  Nothing special, aside from to those colleagues who remembers my 'special day' and who didn't receive the cakes and biscuits it's customary to provide.

So, a few weeks on, and after occasional good-natured banter designed to motivate me, I finally left a few packs of cakes and a box of biscuits in the office kitchen.  Well-received it all was too.

Yeah, *of course* I fear the worst.
