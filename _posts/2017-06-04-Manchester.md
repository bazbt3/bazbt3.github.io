‪We're watching the #OneLoveManchester concert and, perhaps unconventionally, I contributed a few pounds towards the UNHCR ‬Mosul (Iraq) appeal [unhcr.org](http://www.unhcr.org) then signed their #WithRefugees petition [unhcr.org/refugeeday.](http://www.unhcr.org/refugeeday/)

Worldwide more than 65 million people, *greater than the population of the UK*, have had their lives put on hold, been forcibly removed from the safety and security of their homes, and less than a third are being cared for by the UN in *any* manner.

No, this isn't *me* giving *you* a dose of perspective, I haven't got a bloody clue what's going on.  It does need fixing though, and quickly.  Here's a repost of my words from the week of the Manchester bombing: [http://bazbt3.10centuries.org/2017/05/26/ffs-sweary](http://bazbt3.10centuries.org/2017/05/26/ffs-sweary)

One final point, simply attempting vengeance, to kill terrorists without any other coherent strategy to stop ordinary people being turned *into* terrorists, will never work.
