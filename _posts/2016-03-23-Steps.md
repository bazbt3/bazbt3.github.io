A week and a half ago the Sony Lifelog app on my phone announced that I'd passed a milestone: 500,000 recorded steps.

Its not a massive total for the around 5-1/4 months I've been allowing the app to record my comings & goings.  It averages less than 3,200 a day.  But it means I'm on track for over a million in a year.

A step millionaire.

I'm wondering now what it would have been without the 2 days in London (>33,000) and without Ruby dogâ€¦

Thanks; to both bustling metropolis & our chomper.
