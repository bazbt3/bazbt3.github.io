Last weekend we went to Edinburgh, stopped 2 nights, had a really good time.  I counted over 29,000 steps for the trip, feel better for it; a successful weekend all round.

Incidentally, allowing for her growth since our last city excursion, daughter 2 will have walked around 37,000 steps.  We bowed to her request this time, caught a bus for at least a part of our look around the city!

On the way home… 

We stop at a motorway services.  I need a pee so visit the gents.  Washing hands afterwards (fastidious, me) I get a handful of the fluffy soap and place my hand under the automatic tap.

Nothing.

Wave it about, touch the spot I imagine the sensor should be…  Nothing.  Ok, let's try the one to my left…

Same again.

Man to my left looks over, amused.  "Is it me," I say, "I can see my reflection in the mirror; not a vampire."  He laughs and leaves, thank goodness.  I move left yet again, place my hand carefully.  Success!

This morning at work I washed my hands after a, er… (sadly a warm seat this time.)  I used the drier.  Nice and warm.  Lovely and warm in fact.  "Oh yes…" I said, out loud, just as the dryer stopped.

I'd thought I had the gents to myself.

Wrong.

Snuffles wrong!

"Oh no," I said to myself and exited sharply, hoping I'd not been heard.
