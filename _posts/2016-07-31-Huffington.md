Because there's nothing else in this world worth commenting on, not yesterday's family trip to Blackpool, not Brexit, not terrorism or the perceived threats from people we don't know to our way of life, not climate change, not all the other things, I shall post a link to an article about Donald Trump.

Its nothing major, merely relating to yet another of his insensitive statements.  It's nothing particularly inflammatory, especially compared to some of the insane opinions he's voiced, no.

The article itself is, to be fair, almost incidental to the gradual expansion of the footnote accompanying every Trump-related article on the HuffPost site.

Please visit and scroll and click the links within the Editor's Note:

[Trump Responds To Father Of Killed American Soldier, Canâ€™t Name A Single Sacrifice](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_579ce135e4b0e2e15eb61dd9)

Thanks.
