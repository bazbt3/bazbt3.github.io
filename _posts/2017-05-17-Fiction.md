For the last couple of weeks (it seems longer) I've not looked at any of my favourite social networks, and pretty-much ignored the news.  I unintentionally missed May 2017's \#ThemeMonday, and multiple \#WednesdayChallenge writing opportunitiesâ€¦ sorry.

So why?  Why so *anti-social*, why not soak up the UK's political mood now that it *matters*?

I wrote a book.  It's science fiction with a length barely-qualifying as a novella.  So mine isn't a big one.  It's not particularly pretty either, I've *never* written anything this substantial before. 

It *is* here though:

(The credits don't go nearly far-enough.)
