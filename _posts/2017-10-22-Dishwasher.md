title: Dishwasher (sweary)
---

We need a new dishwasher. The old one is at the side of the house awaiting collection by one of the rag-tag bunch of folks who collect scrap metal with no fees, no questions asked.

1. Well-known electrical goods retailer: 10-21 days?  Nope.
2. Well-known online white goods retailer: in stock available for fitting for a very modest fee: 3 days.  Great, I ordered it!  A few minutes after, they phoned.  Nope, computer days no.  Actually, the computer says yes even though they can't meet demand.
3. Well-known premium department store: Next-day delivery and installation for a fee, great!  So I ordered it.  Apparently I qualify for free standard delivery even though I'd be paying for next-day?  Great!  I choose Monday.  It turns out choosing Monday on the mobile site means a week on Monday.  I cancel on the telephone.

For fuck's sake, it's the 21st arsing century, how difficulty can it be to organise delivery efficiently?  To spell things out before the customer presses the poxy button to commit to spending hundreds of pounds onâ€¦

Twats.

17 minutes ago I cancelled.  15 minutes ago I received notice of cancellation and refund.  Just now, just fucking ***NOW***, a text pops up to confirm I'd be getting a dishwasher installed a week on Monday!
