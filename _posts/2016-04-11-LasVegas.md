A colleague and his partner are there right now, starting their first full day.  *I* was there 24 years ago, didn't enjoy the daytimes much; it's a city that's best viewed in the dark, both literally and of the mindset.

My recollection is of air-conditioned, windowless rooms, filled with people dully feeding slot machines and shouting nonsense at the gaming tables.  The nightlife is a different matter though.  Loud, brash, spectacular.

From a quick look at Google Earth the area around my memories seems to have been extensively redeveloped.  I'm no longer sure I'd like to revisit; memories, you know?

I'm pleased to see the volcano opposite Harrah's remains, just up The Strip from the down-a-gap-beteeen-2-buildings Travelodge we stopped in; no longer a Travelodge, I'm not even sure if the *building* exists.

Thanks for provoking the memories nameless-for-blogging-purposes man.  Take it easy though, your 4 hours' sleep may not be *quite* enough to tackle Death Valley.  Mind you, if you're man-enough to wake up her indoors to send her my best wishes for a great holiday at *that* hour you'll probably do just fine.

Water!
