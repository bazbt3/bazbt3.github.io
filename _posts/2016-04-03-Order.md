There are a lot of things in this life that a good Getting Things Done (GTD) or reminder app will help with when attempting to sustain (or create) a sense or order in one's life.

Order is important.

Quite why I used the Amazon Prime Now delivery service - instead of going to the shop - to order the following escapes me.  Necessary, yetâ€¦

In order of ordering:

* A 1kg box of shortbread biscuits,

* A box of Thorntons chocolates (445g or thereabouts),

* A squeezy bottle of tomato ketchup (unfortunately Heinz, it's all they have).
