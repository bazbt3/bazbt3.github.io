App.net's [@lukasros asked](https://posts.app.net/66888589) a couple of days ago:

> "Hello people of App.net! What do you think about having another #ADNHackDay / #CommunityHackDay? <br> Pinging @matigo @33mhz @duerig @ryantharp @flashblu @adnfuture @pamdavis @jvimedia @cgiffard @blumenkraft and everyone else."

The weekend of January 30/31 has been proposed.  And I'm vaguely excited!

"Vaguely" because, as you're probably already aware, I'm not a developer not even a hobbyist coder.  It didn't stop me creating [a thing](https://github.com/bazbt3/ayadn_shell) that came to its ultimate\* fruition only *after* the weekend I participated.  But it was good to watch the evolution of stuff and, though I'd imagine there's no substitute for being *in the same room as* people working feverishly to complete a hack, it was good enough for me.

No, I *don't* know what I'm going to do, or what I'm capable of.  And that's what the inspiration of a community of like-minded, though far better than me at *their* fields, people will imbue in me.  Confidence.  Or fear, too early to say.

Orâ€¦ I'll just read the recap.  Dunno yet!

\*It's really not that good.  And it has the niche-cubed appeal factor.
