title: '10C App list'

I created [a list of apps and integrations](https://github.com/bazbt3/10cv4_stuff/wiki/App-list) currently available for the [10Centuries](https://10centuries.org] social network.

@tomas*(10C)* **[did it better](http://snipergirl.com/10capps/index.php?title=Main_Page)**, and more suitably for collaboration and growth.

Most projects are in the early stages of development but progress is *encouraging.*
