I went online and ordered a kebab and a few other things earlier.  'Twas delicious, but bloody hell that sauce was a bit spicy!

A riddle:

My first is in 'Internet',

My second is in 'lounge',

My third is in 'eating',

My fourth is in 'full',

My fifth is in 'gurgle',

My last is in, er… I'll be right back!

Phew!

So what am I… ?

Yeah, ok, I'm sat on the toilet for a bit.

Will use again.  Why?  Life: a series of paradoxes linked together by uncertainty.  Its good to be grounded every once in a while.
