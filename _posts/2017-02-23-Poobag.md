title: 'Poo bag'

No, not an insult.  Why, when it's absolutely necessary to have a bag for collecting poo, there isn't one?  Why, when it *doesn't* matter, is one's pocket full of the things, often bags sliding languidly to the floor when rummaging for keys, cards, cashâ€¦?

 No social faux-pas here though whatever the circumstances, it's never particularly *awkward*; there are many dog owners out there with a similar sense of responsibility.
 
 To avoid the embarrassment, the angst of returning to the scene of an 'incident' there has to be a better way of remembering allied to a better, more discreet method of poo bag concealed carry.
