title: 'Insignificant fail'
---

At the beginning of February 2016 I decided to use a goal tracker app to create and to keep in touch with blogging and other streaks.  I was pretty conservative with my targets, not wishing to place undue pressure on myself.

Five posts a week?  It SEEMED easy.

I checked just now; such is my lackadaisical approach to the discipline, as of today I must create 22 blog posts a week to hit my target.
