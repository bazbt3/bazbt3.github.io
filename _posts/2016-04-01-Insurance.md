Car insurance: I got home today, opened the insurance company letter, and sat.  Quickly.

They think I'll be paying more than £130 per year *extra* to them.

Ah, no.

A quick price comparison site search shows that, if I'm careful choosing the cover, I could get a policy £500 cheaper than I'd be paying if I allowed inertia to dictate terms.
