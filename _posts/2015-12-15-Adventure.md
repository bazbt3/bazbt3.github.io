Adventure!

For the past few months, on and off, I've been running an adventure game - me as the Game Master* and @mlv (App.net) as the lone player.

It started, innocuously-enough, [here.](https://posts.app.net/64581696)

Here's a [recent map.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0o7nsp2j1mh7fok/START%20Bedroom.pdf?dl=0)

It's been fun making it as we go.  Some stuff is planned, some off-the-cuff in response to Michael's responses, some totally spontaneous, and nothing whatsoever that could be termed capricious behaviour on my part.

You know what, it remains *fun!*  Therapeutic, though from/against what I do not know.  And I don't care.

* Hah!  If I knew what one was Iâ€¦ Ok, it's my first time.
