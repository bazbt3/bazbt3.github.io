## \*\* Newsflash!! \*\*

Dateline: Right now!

I just ate a couple of slices of a Hawaiian pizza I bought for my girls.

(pause for effect…)

And I ***liked*** it.

Yes, I introduced a foodstuff (pineapple) positioned diametrically opposite to my views on the addition of fruit to savoury meals.  One I'd purchased outwith the normal weekly shop…   

Heck, I even carried the thing up the icy path from the village!

I'm not averse to [foodstuffs prepared in challenging ways](https://github.com/bazbt3/recipes/blob/master/Sandwiches/Bazwich.md) but pineapple is one of those polarising fruits; tolerable in isolation, downright *wrong* on a pizza.  Or with gammon.\*

It would appear that 2016 is shaping up to be a year of experimentation, even compromise.

\*Gammon with **egg** FTW!
