title: 'Dishwasher: a sequel (Sweary, NSFW words)'

We needed a new dishwasher.  We **have** a new dishwasher, bought from a well-known Scandinavian flat-pack furniture and accessories retailer.  But this morning I got a call from the well-known UK white goods retailer mentioned in my previous related post.

"Hello Mr Turner, this is Jimbobflibblywibpants [not his real name] calling from GrueGoods.com [not the site] about your delivery today."

Fuck!

He was ringing about the order the retailer and I jointly cancelled a few days ago because they couldn't fit the dishwasher today.

Muppets.  (Would do better.)
