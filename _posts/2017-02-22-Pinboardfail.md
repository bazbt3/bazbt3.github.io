title: 'Pinboard fail'
---

Well, 3 weeks after paying for a Pinboard.in bookmark tagging and page archiving account, I'm no closer to having the site owner fix the issues I've mentioned.

It's the first time tagging made sense to me, thus disappointing that the failures are increasing in scope, tested across a range of operating systems, browsers and apps.

Archiving hasn't started yet despite multiple promises, full-text search is thus impossible, new tags require multiple refreshes to show up and so bundling is problematic, simple searches fail to find bookmarks *visible on the same page!*  I could go on, but the bottom line is when the site owner repeatedly fails to respond and fails to fix the issues I highlight, I complain about, why should I invest more time in the service?

Pinboard.in thus *easily* fails to gain Baz's seal of approval.

I might have to make my own, though it won't reach the *promise* of Pinboard's feature set.  Here's something I put together some time ago; it's generated from a CSV file, no databases to introduce *complexity*.
