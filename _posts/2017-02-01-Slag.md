My wife just called me a [slag](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slag_(disambiguation)).  I honestly cannot believe she meant it in connection with my unconventional delivery of ginger nut biscuits to Ruby dog; mouth-to-mouth.  Surely not.

A period of self-analysis is thus required.  So here I am, cogitating; ginger nuts in one hand, dog restraining the other.
