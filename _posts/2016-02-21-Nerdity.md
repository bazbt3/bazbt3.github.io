Another short one today; it's been a 'nothing' weekend outside my ongoing Raspberry Pi playtime.

Here's a repeat link to what I wanted to do with it, what I've done, and what I've actually accomplished so far - which is actually now 2/3 of the total.

[My Raspberry Pi Setup](https://github.com/bazbt3/raspberry_pi_setup) - at GitHub.com.

So, what *else* have I accomplished?

* Walked Ruby dog,
* Helped with the girls' homework,
* Bought a pair of walking shoes to replace those that Ruby chomped,
* Washed, dried, put away clothes,
* Changed the cat litter,
* Been shown a paint colour chart; my wife's chosen a new colour for the hallwayâ€¦

In-short, underperformed.
