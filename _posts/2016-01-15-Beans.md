The story of [Jack and the Beanstalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_and_the_Beanstalk) encompasses a great many moral lessons, chief of which is planting magic beans isn't always the easiest path to riches.

I've lost count of the number of magic beans I planted over the years, but there the similarity to the fairy (or is it folk?) story's eponymous protagonist ends; I'm not a thief or murderer.

I've *felt like* turning to the dark side a good few times when my plans have come to naught, but this sense of morality always intrudes.

Maybe it's a good thing.

I'm occasionally advised to play the long game; to be patient and realise 'these things [actually do] take time.'

I'm reminded of [Isaac Asimov's 'Nightfall'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightfall_(Asimov_short_story_and_novel)) - and what might happen were I to see the fruits of my labours spread out before me, their collective greatness too awful for mortal man to behold unfiltered.

So-oooâ€¦

*What* will the UK retirement age be for a man of my years?
