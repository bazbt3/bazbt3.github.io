title: Hotdogs
---

Dinner today will be easy: hotdogs, buns to encase them, tomato ketchup.  That's me and the girls accounted for.

I read the cooking instructions on the label.  Bad move.  Not the act of reading, no, it's what I read of the ingredients.

Mechanically-separated chicken.

I'm hoping against hope it means something like free-range does for eggs, but that the chickens wear inflatable 'skirts' to protect them against farmyard collisions.
