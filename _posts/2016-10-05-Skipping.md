title: Skipping

My oldest daughter skipped into Brownies this evening.  Most encouraging, if you know her.

Chatting briefly with one of the mothers I came to the realisation something is missing from my life.  Now, I can ride a bike; I can, I'd presume, fall off a log (and sleep like one.)

Skipping.  I tried to, briefly, but it wasn't prettyâ€¦  I have completely forgotten how to skip.

I need to practise.  At work during lunchtime, perhaps?  Along the road I live on?  No.

Taking the girls into school, across the playground?  At my age?
