title: '3 Wolves and Moon'

My boss wore a work-commemorative T-shirt all day today; as these things do it got me thinking about life-changing events.

I made the first step today towards changing mine.

Not acknowledging a suppressed mid-life crisis, not starting a life of crime or male modelling (despite the incessant demands to), not even thinking of dressing on the other side, no.

So, whilst at work I ordered a Three Wolf Moon t-shirt from Amazon, yes.

It arrives sometime tomorrow and, though I may not have time to wash and dry it prior to dress-down Friday, I nevertheless intend to wear it.

Now, if anything I've read about the power inherent in the shirts is true, however minuscule its effects are for meâ€¦ it's fair to say I'm expecting great things.

After a reasonably productive day I arrived home.

Heck, we have new neighbours!

It's started.
