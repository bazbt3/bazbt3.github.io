title: 'Home Alone'

Most people faced with a day off, and family away during a school holiday week would, I'd guess, go insane and do all kinds of exciting things.

Today I ran out of Earl Grey tea *and* burnt last night's pizza instead of gently reheating it in the oven.

The *highlight* of my day then has been the successful, if well overdue, defrosting of the freezer.  During the mammoth session I discovered that the ice above the top serpentine had built to such a thickness and expanded to such a degree that it'd pulled out one of its supporting bracket screws.  The left front one!  Danger, mild peril!  And the thermocouple is a bit floppy now but seems to work; no signs of an impending ice age *yet*.

Incidentally, IKEA-Whirlpool didn't make frost-free fridge-freezers when we put the kitchen in.

Yeah.

Yeah.
