title: Jetwash

My girls and wife went out to the craft shop earlier, getting stuff to decorate their Easter bonnets.  I jetwashed the patio - this time with the lance rather than the usual brush with rotating jets.

Not the best idea I've ever had; there was mud *everywhere*; along the path down the side of the house, on the walls, sheds, plastic wendy-house, in my shoes, socks, jeans and undies; there still *is* some along the side of the house.

Andâ€¦

I flooded the utility room; the hose/tap adaptor is rubbish.

Thank goodness for fluffy towels!
