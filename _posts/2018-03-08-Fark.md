How I explain [Fark.com](https://fark.com):

> "It's a news aggregator site with a difference; people submit headlines and go to the forums to excoriate others for the smallest thing, like making a [Brussels sprout burrito](https://fark.com/comments/9716024/first). Would you try one, just to humour me, please?"
