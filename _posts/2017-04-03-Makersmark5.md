Drunk again with 1-1/2 ice cubes with me at room temperature, *this* time after recently eating strawberries & shaken (not whipped) cream: oh no, that unpleasant taste remains. 

Still smells amazing, rich, sherry, butterscotch, etc; this really does bear repeating.

I'd better conclude this at some pointâ€¦
