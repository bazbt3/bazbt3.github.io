Bradley Wiggins is the latest target in the establishment's moral crusade, a bunch of MPs being of the opinion Cycling's sporting ethics have been breached.

They're suggesting that drugs deemed to be legal by the sport's governing body have been used to artificially enhance Team Sky's performance in general and Wiggins' in particular.  No mention has been made of the possibility that every team at the top of world cycling *might* be doing exactly the same; that'd be inconvenient, hackers won't have presented 'em the evidence on a silver platter. 

This sad bunch, by the way, is drawn partly from the MPs awarded a pay rise approaching double that of the public sector workers they're tasked with awarding pay rises to.  *There's* the ethics violations, the obvious lack of moral fibre.
