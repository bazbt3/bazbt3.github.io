I made a conscious choice to develop my 10Centuries.org app ([10cbazbt3.py](https://github.com/bazbt3/10cbazbt3)) in Python 3.x.  Python 3.x was introduced in 2008, 2.x updates ended in 2010; 3.x seemed a logical choice.

If *only* I'd read a little deeper.

Even developing a trivial Python app to run on Google's Android OS requires Python 2.7.  That's *requires.*  I don't have a Mac or a daily driver iPhone so cannot develop for OS X or iOS.  An interesting recent development though (thanks for the tip @jmreekes) is that the iOS Pythonista app is being updated (parallel app development) to support Python 3.x.

Why do I care?  Mine is a personal project, right?  The very earliest stages of development, right?

Yeah, about that…

It's good when someone shows an interest in a thing one's created.  But to be unable to use it because their workflow is based entirely around a deprecated version of the language one's working with…

It's understandable; when even Google continues to use it because to *not* would introduce massive compatibility/update issues, why rock the boat?

But there are further obstacles to overcome before my thing is anything other than a *post-only* 10C client:

* Making sense of the API JSON so that a user can interact without the needing to read through pages of 'gibberish',
* Cross-platform compatibility,
* And [other stuff…](https://github.com/bazbt3/10cbazbt3/issues)

Aaah… Dunno.
