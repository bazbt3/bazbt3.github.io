I have absolutely no desire to learn command-line Git; the available GUI-based tools are more than sufficient for me, and especially that installed on my Android phone.

I'll let that sink inâ€¦ 

I use the really rather good [Pocket Git](http://pocketgit.com/), allied with its companion text editor [DroidEdit](http://www.droidedit.com/).  The only thing it seems to be missing, for this novice at least, is 'Issues' support.

Besides, [github.com](http://www.github.com) has, in theory, that and everything *else* I need.  (But I have the [ForkHub](https://github.com/jonan/ForkHub) app anyway.)

Having a Git app on my phone, and working with a tiny amount of text visible above the virtual keyboard, might seem silly.  But, I need no Internet connection to work on my stuff - not, that is, until it gets to a push.

Incidentally, DroidEdit isn't a text editor.  It's a source code *and* text editor with syntax highlighting, and has support for "Dropbox, Drive, Box, (S)FTP servers and Git." 

I haven't given anything Baz's Seal of approval recently.  Pocket Git and DroidEdit both get awards.
