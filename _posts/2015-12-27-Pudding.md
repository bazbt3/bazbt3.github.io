I just now had my Christmas Pudding.  It was delicious, laced with brandy and, I think, rum, and covered with single cream - and 'twas an individual-sized portion.

Why individual?

My wife doesn't like it and my daughters (8 & 6) don't have alcohol for obvious reasons (and don't like rich fruit cakes anyway.)

Ruby puppy\* sat and waited for a while, ever hopeful, but my resolve never weakened.
