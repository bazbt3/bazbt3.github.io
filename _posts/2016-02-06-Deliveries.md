I'm sat on the toilet, right now.

Expecting a delivery from Amazon, needing a poo, I'd asked my mother-in-law if she'd keep an eye out for the delivery, mentioned that I'd left the key in the door, and finished by saying "I'm tempting fate here."

The doorbell rang the very *instant* I sat.

Is telepathy a part of the delivery driver training regimeâ€½
