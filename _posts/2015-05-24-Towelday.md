title: 'Towel Day tomorrow!'
---

There's a day set aside every year to commemorate the life and works of the late literary great Douglas Adams.  It's May 25th to be precise.  It's *tomorrow!*

There's a web site, so I'm posting a link to the [towelday.org FAQ.](http://towelday.org/faq/index.html)

FYI, I count The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy as one of my all-time favourite novel trilogies (I have all five parts of it!), radio series, TV series, computer games, and yes, even the 2005 movie!

Yes, I *do* know where my towel is, it's completely awesome.  And yes, I will be carrying it around with me *all day.*
