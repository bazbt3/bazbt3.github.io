title: 'Bye Medium'
---

I've been copying my blog posts, first manually then more recently automatically, to Medium.com (a site for writers or anyone with a message.)  The return on my investment has not been great, indeed the most views and feedback I've had has been from a one-line comment I posted in response to someone else's political post.

I say investment but it's no biggie; I'd written the posts anyway, it costs nothing to post at Medium, and I write to please myself *anyway*.  But almost zero feedback troubled me.

Why?  Well, everywhere else I post I've been careful to avoid statistics.  Indeed I've never looked at any stats related to my Github.com Pages, and have no intention of doing.  Simply put, I have a tendency to obsess over the irrelevant things when the simple things are key.

I'm thinking of terminating postings to Medium, and soon.  A related and more positive issue, I still have a plan to release posts from previous incarnations of my blog, and that'd kill the structure, the *flow*, at Medium (I prefer consecutive posts, sorted by date.  Obviously by date.)

The bonus: the meanderings of my less-recent mind will soon be available to reminisce over.  It's not *all* bad.
