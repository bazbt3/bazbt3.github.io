My eyesight is deteriorating as I age.  In the early nineties (last century!) I was short-sighted and experienced headaches whilst driving.  Now it's the long-sightedness of my advancing years.

We get regular eye tests at work but my urge to remedy the sight issue has fallen between the cycles.  No problem, I bought my own - [these.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0085ALIRQ)  They have spring-loaded sides which, it has to be said, gave me some initial discomfort.  Running boiling water over the sides and gently re-shaping to fit my unique head profile proved a permanent solution.

Now, I think they add an air of sophistication to my otherwise-morose appearance, and the design fits my needs very well.  I can read comfortably and, if needs be, look up at my family or the telly without too much re-focus disorientation.

The best bit - their aspect ratio means I can look *over* the top of the frame without touching the glasses!

Look, I *know* I should have visited a qualified optometrist/optician butâ€¦

For the reasons outlined above, and for the freedom-from-magnifying-glasses this product brings me, I award Baz's seal of approval
