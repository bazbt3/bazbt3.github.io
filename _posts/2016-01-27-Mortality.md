"Simple life *good.*"\*

Er… I shall stop talking like the village idiot now.

'Life' is now too complex for me, has been for quite some time, and it frustrates all my efforts to simplify situations.

Borrowing from a previous blog post, 'Paris':

> "Life is complicated.  Living it is easy.  Put one foot in front of another, breathe in, breathe out, drink, blink, eat, pee, poo, sleep, work, play, laugh, cry.  And then it's over.
> 
> There is more, of course.  Aspiration.  The latest smartphone, TV, games console, car, a house, family, friends, safety…"

I wrote on for a bit in a similar vein.  Heck, there may even have been a *point* to it at the time, but all that's forgotten already - and by pretty much everyone who 'lived' the events of the day the post refers to.

Luckily for me we live in an age where life-expectancy is great enough that, for quite some time to come, I will be yearning for an age that *might* have existed before even *I* entered this world.  I'm in my forty-eleventh year in this planet dontcha know!

It's an age of simplicity, this thing in my head, but one in which even the now-simplest-to-treat ailment (scurvy, for instance) could have propelled me in particular headlong into the cart on the way to that pauper's grave.

One small positive here; we have the choice where we end up nowadays.  Ok, we've the *illusion* of choice; the family's wishes will surely trump mine.  Whether it happens or not I've at least *asked* to be burnt when it's my time.

No cart for me!
