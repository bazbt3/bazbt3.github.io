I'm thinking of having a sign, a notice, a warning of sorts made up; a notification to those who would disturb my evenings or weekends with unsolicited offers to do work for or sell goods to us.  The doorbell rings and… Ok, ok, I wrote about [this phenomenon previously](http://bazbt3.10centuries.org/2017/03/21/cold-caller) *and* about [the telephone equivalent](http://bazbt3.10centuries.org/2017/02/16/unsolicited) too.

Today I simply walked out of the front room into the kitchen, and ignored the second ring too.  This visit would have fit the pattern: 'Hello, we've just finished some work in the area and…'  I recognise the van.

Ah, the sign.

"The man of the house isn't immediately cheerful to unsolicited callers.  Could we pay nothing now, at 0%, balance due by the then-homeowner in 35 years?"

Too wordy?
