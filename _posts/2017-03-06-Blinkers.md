We went to the pictures yesterday, to watch the Lego Batman Movie.  I suspended my sense of disbelief as usual and yes, cried near the end.  Who knew that hanging a *picture* could be so moving‽

To get the film review out of the way, it's fantastic, obviously it is, with an opening sequence that rivals pretty much anything I've seen I all my years (old git.)  One of the *best* scenes in it, a precursor of what's to come, involves heating Lobster Thermidor in a microwave.

Yeah ok, YMMV.

On the way out to the car after spending more money than I intended to (two large Belgian chocolate milkshakes for the girls, from the Costa Coffee) a colleague spotted me, and made his (and his family's) presence known.  Upon him asking how the film was, all I could do was mock-rub my eyes, indicating 'it's a tearjerker', and we parted ways.

Interesting that, I've always tended to have tunnel-vision, a single-minded sense of purpose when…

If anyone ever see me walking the streets (or, it's even worse in the car) and I apparently blank them, it really *is* my inability to focus on anything but the one thing at the centre of my attention.  Yesterday's thing: safely getting the girls to the car.  Thirty years ago?  Making sure I completed the jog without stray dogs, cars or *pedestrians* breaking my rhythm.

So don't be shy.
