title: 'The Day After Tomorrow'
---

We just watched [The Day After Tomorrow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_After_Tomorrow) again, a fine film and one of my favourites.

Perhaps the events of the last few months have sharpened, enhanced my senses, but I've moved away from appreciation of the film for its obvious climate change slant alone, and towards the now obvious message that 'cooperation' is the key to our future, not isolation and complacency.

An extended quote *([Wikiquote](https://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Day_After_Tomorrow))* from the film:

> “These past few weeks have left us all with a profound sense of humility in the face of nature's destructive power. For years, we operated under the belief that we could continue consuming our planet's natural resources, without consequence. We were wrong. *I* was wrong. The fact that my first address to you comes from a consulate on foreign soil is a testament to our changed reality. Not only Americans, but people all around the globe have become guests in the nations we once called 'the third world'. In our time of need they have taken us in and sheltered us, and I am deeply grateful for their hospitality."

Oh, if only there was some substitution I could make for climate change here…

Yes, *of course* I cried at the end!
