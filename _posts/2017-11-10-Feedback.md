title: 'Feedback (LibDems)'

Online feedback I provided to the UK Liberal Democrat party after being asked why I've not renewed my membership:

> "During the General Election and Brexit campaigns the party failed to detail the compromises you found necessary to remain a partner in government with the Tories. When presented with in-your-face opportunities to spell out the goals junked by the LibDems to allow moderation of socially egregious Tory policies, every one of your representatives rolled over and failed to spell it out for the benefit of the casual voter. The public in general are sheep, have binary choices - Labour or Tories - their impression is the LibDems are Tory-lite; you'll have a long, long time in the wilderness being nice to the nasty party."
