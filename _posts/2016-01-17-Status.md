A recent all-too-brief conversation prompted me to think about what defines the success of a social network.

In my world it's not about the numbers of users, nor is it the number of followers, nor is it measured by the number of visits, replies, mentions or comments on linked posts.

Here's my list:

* Engagement,
* Quality,
* Fun.

And here, better than I could ever put into words in any coherent and manner approaching brevity, is a diagram of the inner workings of my mind.
