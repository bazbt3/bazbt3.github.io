title: 'Easter egg'
---

The Trumps flew to Florida on Friday, [in separate jets.](https://www.queerty.com/donald-melania-fly-separate-taxpayer-funded-planes-20170414)  Its looking as though [they'll miss the annual Easter Egg Roll](https://www.queerty.com/easter-white-house-ruined-thanks-melania-trump-sad-20170412), a 138-year-old tradition, will be somewhat curtailed in scope.  A shame.

From the second article:

> "Since 1878, the Easter Egg Roll has always been coordinated by the first lady. Seeing as how Mrs. Trump not only lives 200 miles away from the White House, but has yet to bother putting together an official staff, this year’s event, like Trump’s numbers in the popular vote, is expected to underperform *bigly*."

(The writer's emphasis.)

Is anyone taking bets it'll be recorded as the most successful event ever?  Forget tradition, tradition is not for those looking to the future!  Forget history, history is tor those who would read books.  Books, books are for…

No.

I *had* intended to write about [the passing at 117 of the world's oldest person, Emma Morano,](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39610937) but my attention spa…

Yeah.  It's very unlikely there's anyone else alive born in the 1800s, the nineteenth century, the end of the Victorian era.  Imagine the social, the technological change she'll have seen living through the entire 20th century.  I simply cannot imagine the personal losses she'll have endured; every family member…

I'm having a profound moment here, not an epiphany as there's something quite logical about the effect of extreme age on statistics.  No, mine is a sense of missing something.

There's a scene in one of the Lord of the Rings movies which brought to life something I'd never really considered in depth.  The specific scene, though powerful, is unimportant here; what is is something seen in old, grand churches: statues side-by-side above stone tombs, once lovers, creators of life, holders of shared dreams, together forever in stone, mourned by fewer and fewer and then none as the passage of time takes those who once *knew…*

Yeah, sure it's a privileged few afforded such a luxury in death.  The common man gets nothing likely to last even tens of years.  The despots, the landowners, the moneyed classes of our history: immortalised.

Will the Trump era be looked back on with anything approaching warmth, a sense of a shared timespan, a belief of having achieved something?

Can I place a bet?

Incidentally, I have [a bragging-rights-only wager with @texrat (Twitter), that the White House Press Secretary will last only until late August 2017.](https://twitter.com/texrat/status/823630847794356225)  Randall thought he'd be gone roughly by the end of March.  Not roughly, I think I mean *approximately*.  Perhaps; I'm still suffused by Schadenfreude.
