title: 'Beauty and the Beast'
---

My youngest daughter and I went to the movies again today, to watch Beauty and the Beast, a film my oldest had seen mid-week.  In my own inimitable fashion I enjoyed the tale yet again, and ignored the chance that I'd be offended by the peripheral fuss surrounding the movie.

I wouldn't have been, by the way; it'd pass unnoticed were it not for the fact I was *expecting* something.  What sad lives people must have, picking apart harmless entertainment and ignoring history.

Anyway, afterwards we walked across to McDonald's and bought 2 chicken nugget Happy Meals, which we ate in the car.  Mine came with an orange-roofed Smurf house.

The movie and the meal gain Baz's seal of approval.
