During November 2015 I decided to start a daily journal - an activity which soon changed into an almost-daily series of blog posts.  During the time since I've noticed a shift in the way I approach social media.  I'm not sure I like it.

The blogging exercise quickly morphed into a need to create a test site, added to GitHub.com in parallel to my main 10Centuries blog account.  I've also been experimenting with rudimentary self-hosting.

As this has happened I've been neglecting both my blog and those people who comment on the posts.  I've not even been keeping up with the shiny new 10Centuries.org after my initial flurry of (hopefully constructive) fault reporting during the early private beta stage.

So it's time for a rethink.

Sure it may be the time of year at fault; I'm not alone in noticing a realignment of priorities away from social media.  But this time around I'm analysing in a bit more depth.

Soâ€¦

Rather than concentrate on 'self' I think it's time I looked at others' blogs.  It's only fair.

I've quite a backlog of posts in my RSS feed reader.  Time to read, folks.

If you have a blog of your own please let me know, if I have or if I haven't already got it queued up I'll take a look!

Thanks!
