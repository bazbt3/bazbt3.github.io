[Can modern incarnation of C5 succeed?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38960275) *(BBC)*

I'm easily old enough to remember the original 3-wheeled washing-machine-motor-powered death-trap, the only safety aid a flag flapping above on a flexible whip shaft, but didn't see one for real until years later, in a museum.

I view the name Sinclair with fondness.  I owned a ZX81 (with 16K wobbly RAM Pack, a Spectrum 48K and thermal printer, and an almost-totally-impractical in-ear radio.  I still *want* a red-LED RPN calculator, bug-ridden as I know it to be.

Though modern cars are *far* safer than during the 1980s, the roads are fuller and the drivers less-attentive than ever.  So I confidently predict that [Betteridge's Law of Headlines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines) applies here.

The answer to the question the headline poses: No, no more-so than ever.
