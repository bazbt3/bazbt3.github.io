There's no easy way to say this.  I've been neglecting my blog, I've hardly looked at the four social networks I've got accounts with.  Heck, I even missed posting in the weekly WednesdayChallenge.

I'm obsessed by something I've never done before, something a number of people have done historically, and experienced the darkest times of their lives.

Yes, I'm writing a book.

Not a book, no.  It's a novella.  Well ok, I don't know.  Novellas are probably longer than 7,500 words, where novels have more than 17,500 words.  It depends who's setting the rules.

In this case, me!  Right now *I've* broken off, at 4,710, to compose this blog post.

Science fiction isn't everybody's cup of tea, so I'm not hoping for fame and fortune.

You know how everyone's supposed to have a niche set aside for their fifteen minutes of fame, and everyone has a novel inside them?  Well, if anyone were to read mine, I would appreciate it if they ensured mine remained outside my personal comfort zone.

Yeah, I'll post a link when the plot is fleshed out a bit more.  For now though, there's this:
