title: 'Stop Making Sense'

Aw crap, the cat's looking at me in that way again.  Not sure where my uncontrollable giggling came from there, but he's right to look askance.

Or *am* I not sure‽

Ok, ok.  Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey with a single ice cube in a thistle-shaped glass bought for me by my wife-to-be on March 26th 2005, accompanied very loudly indeed by The Pump Panel remix of New Order's 'Confusion' and then Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense album, they might be *something* to do with it.  The latter songs take me back, what…

Forty.

Years.

To the time I first heard 'em.

1977 seems a *bit* early though, being honest.  35 years ago is maybe getting there, around the time of the best music documentary film ever.  That seems a *bit* short though, I'm sure I heard 'em first before they became popular in the UK.  Maybe.  Dunno.

Shut up Barrie.
