2015 was a year with a *lot* of downs, and I'll be glad to see its end.  Really.  There were of course positives, but overall zero sense of *balance.*

2014 was equally odd in that regard; my wife nearly died in the July and, restricting myself to social networking, I'd:

* Messed about with Linux doing some, what I'd call, rudimentary shell script coding based on top of [Ayadn](https://github.com/ericdke/na/blob/master/README.md) - a command line client for the App.net social network,
* Inexplicably tailed off from my initial enthusiasm with the [App.net Wiki](http://appdotnetwiki.net/), and have struggled to retain that,
* Told everyone I wasn't going to be using Facebook again,
* Or Twitter.

### 2015, a year in review:

*This* year I continued my idiosyncratic approach:

* Increasing my use of footnotes\* in social media posts,
* Adopting the [Oxford Comma] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) more widely, occasionally even abbreviating the following "and" to "&"!  And, even though I know it's not its only use case, preceding only "and" gives me room to grow,
* Starting to use the [Semicolon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon) more frequently.

This last one puzzles me.  Until late this year I'd almost never used it, succumbing as I did to peer pressure during my final couple of years at school by intentionally not *caring* about 'English' lessons.  So why now?

A desire for self-improvement perhaps?

2015 also brought:

* A late-year increase in the frequency of my blog posts, partially in response to installing the [Journey](http://2appstudio.com/journey/) (daily) journal app on my Android phone,
* My slow-but-sure takeover of the [#ThemeMonday](http://appdotnetwiki.net/w/index.php?title=ThemeMondayhashtag) hashtag on App.net (page needs updating.)  I make the call to choose a shortlist of themes, collate, remind, and then post a poll to get votes to pick each.  It's not hard work, not really.

So, this blog post ends as the year ends, on a low note:

2015 does *not* get Baz's Seal of Approval; really, it's had very, very few highlights.

The *only* standout was a weekend trip to London with my family, my first.  (Family *and* trip to England's capital.)

\*I can't honestly recall when I started using footnotes, it *could* have been 2014.

I reserve the right to edit this post as events unfold on this, the last day of the year.  Naturally I reserve the right to edit *all* the posts but rarely do, aside from typos.
