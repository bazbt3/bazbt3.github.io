I have a theory: that Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was *close* when wondering that, if the secret of the universe was ever found, it would be replaced by something even more improbable.

It happened, someone found it, or at least the secret of the bit over which humanity believes they have a loose measure of control.  Why *else* would our world be changed daily beyond our understanding upon awakeningâ€½

Douglas Adams:

Prompted by @der_jeff:
