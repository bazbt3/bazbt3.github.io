New Year's Resolutions kept:  none, though the subtleties of the choices made leave me a modicum of wriggle room.

* **Picking at my thumbnails at the traffic lights on the way to work**: Fail.  I should go a different way.
* **Reducing sugars in my tea at home**: Technically a great success.  The fact that I've not drunk tea at home during 2017 cheapens this a bit; the fact it's been all chai since Christmas means I'm floundering, adrift, rudderless here.
* **Eating more healthily**: Yes.  More nuts, oats, erâ€¦ healthy foods and in moderation too;  less bread, biscuits/cookies.  I take a cholesterol-reducing drink daily.  The 16" kebab pizza last weekend was atypical.
* **Exercising**: Fail.  I walk a bit, nowhere near enough to qualify as a person who walks.
* **The thing that shall not be mentioned in polite society**: Yup, still doing that.
