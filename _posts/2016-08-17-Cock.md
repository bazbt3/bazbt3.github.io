Behold!  You know when a dog listens to you, listens so intently and with total focus that there is no doubt it understands you?  And it cocks its head on one side as-if to underscore the extent of its devotion?  Marvellous!  Ruby dog often evokes that feeling of omnipotence, yes.

Oh I wish there was a drug I could have produced in large-enough quantities, and then have delivered to the human (and near-human) population of this island nation by a fleet of autonomous drones.  A drug to at least mimic that response in others.  Wouldn't that be greatâ€½

Yes, obviously.  And then, the world!

Let's face it though, I'm more likely to get that sort of response if I become a boy band or enter politics.

Everyone knows where those two paths lead, so I'd best not.
