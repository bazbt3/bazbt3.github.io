title: 'Sprout burrito inventor'
---

In an attempt to reinvent myself on social networks I've been silent for a long while, to let the old stuff out and the void in.  That's not to say I haven't missed the interactions, I have.  But life, as-ever, got in the way.

I'm not back yet, far from it, but I see encouraging signs.  One of them was an attempt to engage with people I don't know on IRC.  It's literally 20 years since the last time I had a go, and there's no coincidence that was also my first try; it's synchronous chat, quite a fast-paced, and an unforgiving environment.  But once in, it appears a sense of community remains.  Nerds, geeks abound.  The attempt went reasonably well, but I definitely sensed some insularity, mistrust of outsiders; most unlike the entirely positive experiences on the 3 most-recent small networks it's been my privilege to be involved with.

So, to the title of this post?

First, it might be, though probably isn't, a good idea to read this:

["Today, after a lot of procrastination, I will eat my first-ever burrito. I'll post a picture of the uncooked thing momentarily. Later this year, a visit to Taco Bell UK"](https://fark.com/comments/9712134/first)

And then this:

["Following up yesterday's first-ever burrito, I'm making my own from leftovers: Mashed sprouts, sweetcorn, redcurrant jelly, tiny squirt of ketchup. In the oven now, wrapped in foil"](https://fark.com/comments/9713006/first)

Incidentally, the mobile version of the Fark site works really well on mobile devices.

Getting there, not just socially.
