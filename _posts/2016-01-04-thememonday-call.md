title: ThemeMonday 2016 January 11
---

In a new departure, I'm experimenting with a blog post to call ADN to choose our #ThemeMonday theme for January 2016.

For more information, see the [ThemeMonday](/thememonday/) page.

So here we go, please think what you'd like to see this month and tell us all.  Seasonal themes, silly , sexy or serious themes; it's *your* ADN to shape as you will.  Make the most of this opportunity!

Please reply to ADN post thread when you see it.

Thanks!
