It's nearly 4 years since the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.  4 years.  Wow!

Rio De Janeiro!

Er…

Where's the advance publicity here in the UK?  Look, I know a country hosting an event is bound to have a crazy run-up to the main event; local interest in the shape of homegrown heroes\* and the possibility of winning a ticket lottery to view a niche sport on a weekday evening are things everyone can grasp hold of…

*Who* are we supporting this time?

\*No, not heroes.  *Emphatically*-not heroes.  Role models of course (until the wheels fall off) but a single-minded dedication to accuracy or speed does *not* a hero make.
