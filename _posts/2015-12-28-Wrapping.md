title: Wrapping
---

To be absolutely fair to her, my wife shouldered the burden of wrapping the presents prior to Christmas.  Most at least.

Today she's taking the girls to see her friend; they're off to visit a soft play place for a few hours, and I'm left in peace.

Ahhhâ€¦

But, as-ever, a last-minute rush to wrap those gifts, and an 'emergency' trip by my wife to the toy shop for the youngest recipient, left me wrapping the few allocated to those lovely people.

I didn't moan or sulk or internalise, no.  I just got on with it and wrapped.

It seems my New Year's Resolutions have just been implemented.  Early, too!

I'd best make some for 2016.
