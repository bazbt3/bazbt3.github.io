In a hurry to leave the house this morning, head befuddled by sleep, I failed in one important detail.  Important.

The orientation of my new, gaudily-coloured boxer shorts unfortunately precludes my ability to pee stood up.  I'm also imagining the wind blowing unfettered where it ought not to…

The good news: my work toilet seat streak remains cold; unblemished by recent prior other-arse occupancy.

It's the small things in life…
