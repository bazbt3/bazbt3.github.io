First question of the year: have any of you managed to register with AgeID?

Given the simple fact we're 2 weeks away from the implementation of this significant part of the UK government's Digital Economy Act 2017 it seems indicative of a wider ineptitude stifling our country that "Registration is not available in your country yet."

How very 'English'.

(Of course it might work if I wasn't so reliant on doing everything on my phone.)
