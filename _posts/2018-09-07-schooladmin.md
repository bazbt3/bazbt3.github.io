Daughter 2 started high school this week, and got a lesson timetable which, well, why not read the email I just sent to the school:

> Hi, and sorry to bother you with this,

> Is there any chance you could prepare a lesson timetable for us that spells out the lesson names in full, in plain English, and provide an explanation what the remaining '7*' abbreviations mean?  Being frank, I find its current presentation almost completely incomprehensible; if we're going to ensure [daughter 1] (who is autistic) arrives at school with the right equipment daily we too need a bit of help.

> Thanks in advance for your consideration, and for reading this, [etc.]
