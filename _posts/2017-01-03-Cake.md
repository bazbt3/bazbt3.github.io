title: 'Cake culture'

After reading this, I've a question for anyone arriving here accidentally…

[Dentists call to end cake culture](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38491414) - BBC News.

Go on then, instead of Krispy-Kremes who's up for kumquats or kiwifruits‽

It might have been BBC's Tomorrow's World, it was certainly decades ago.  I recall a TV spot devoted to dental health, specifically the question; which is best for your teeth, an apple a day (doctors can't be wrong) or a nice piece of cheese?

Unsurprisingly, most opted for the apple-a-day, disregarding the deleterious effects of the acids present in most fruit.

But at least the article above got me thinking.  Which was nice.

On the occasion of my next birthday I'm of the mind to subject my colleagues to a mouthful of abuse!
