title: 'Ramadan Mubarak'

Ramadan Mubarak to anyone observing it or supporting those who are!  If you're fasting, take it easy, be sensible,  

A guy I know reckons he'll have a six-pack by Eid-Al-Fitr.  I think not, not if what I understand about the limited time available to eat is correct.

I rashly accepted his 'challenge' though.  Yeah, I know it sounds frivolous, trivialising the month.  No.

Yes.  I'm a clockwork idiot; my waistline is heading in ENTIRELY the wrong direction.
