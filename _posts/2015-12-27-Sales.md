The seasonal sales have already started. In fact, some have been going on, on-and-off, since the week before Black Friday.

What have we bought?

I got a shoulder bag for my wife, a vibrant red thing of the same design as her black one.  A *genuine* half price.

The laptop she bought before the sales commenced has been reduced by the same retailer in their Boxing Day sale by a whopping £200!  To exactly what she paid for it.

The Xbox One with Kinect, the thing I wanted in the Black Friday sales - the one that the day before was £350, on the day £370, and the day after dropped to £340 - is now £335.  Cheaper with 3 games than without.

Crazy!

So, what do we *need*?

* A TV stand.
* Wireless printer & scanner (Canon.)
* Coke Zero.
* Dog food.

Not believing the hype: Easy.
