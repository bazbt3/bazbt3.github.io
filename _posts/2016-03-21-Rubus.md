title: 'Rubus cockburnianus'

My wife was watching TV earlier; Monty Don, the gardening programme host, mentioned a flower variety and I'm assuming a caption appeared onscreen.

A quote from her email:

Soâ€¦

**Rubus cockburnianus.**

Really.

It's a bramble.

Do your own research.  It's real, not a 'funny' Wikipedia plant.
