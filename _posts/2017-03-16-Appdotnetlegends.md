title: 'App.net legends'
---

Just short of a millennium ago, and handily beating Project Gutenberg, the Chinese invented movable type.  Thus began the slow march of the dissemination of things important and unimportant (though perhaps entertaining) through the intervening ten centuries towards this, our almost ephemeral, digital age.

As App.net (ADN) haltingly passes into the realm of myths and fables an 11th-hour equitable stay was granted by the legend that is @berg; time to fix and thus allow the network's inhabitants to download and unpack their digital memories.

24 more hours, the blink of an eye, and an ending somehow slightly less-memorable than of [The Ides Of March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_of_March); a date I'm sure that was chosen to be symbolic.  Symbolic of *what* though?

How many Orcs though, how many Goblins, Men, Elves, nameless dark forces from the east, how many Trolls were slain during the time ADN shone?  How many [Adventures](http://bazbt3.github.io/theadventure/) were had along the road?  How many people met, spoke in hushed (and not-so-hushed) tones, whilst forging lasting alliances over cloudy ale and Elven Lembas bread?

Ok, enough allusions to Tolkien-esque worlds; wasn't it ***fun***‽

Simply, yes.

Incidentally, if you came to this scroll of mine expecting a list of legendary folk, instead look in at [10Centuries.org](https://10Centuries.org) and [pnut.io](https://pnut.io) and see who's there.

Do it.

I have invitation codes for both networks, just [ask.](http://bazbt3.10centuries.org/contact)

Do it, do it now, lest ye be eaten by a [grue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grue_(monster)) or (shudders) settle for Twitter!

(time passes…)

Have you done it yet‽

Who knows, before we know it, people could be telling tales of *our* later legendary exploits.
