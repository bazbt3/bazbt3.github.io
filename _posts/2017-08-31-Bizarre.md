Returning to the recent [Sprout Burrito](http://bazbt3.10centuries.org/2017/08/28/sprout-burrito-inventor) theme, this from Fark;  ["Hey, at least it's got beans on it now B-b-burrito? DIT"](https://m.fark.com/comments/9716024/first)

The best comment across a couple of hundred posts, the *very* best, most succinct whilst retaining a flavour of what they must be thinking:

> "This is some bizarre performance art or a social experiment. Regardless, there's no excuse for these 'burritos' should they exist. They are an abomination."
