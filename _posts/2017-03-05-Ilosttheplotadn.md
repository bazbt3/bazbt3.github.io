title: 'I lost the plot (ADN)'
---

A slice of history: me reading out loud a blog post I wrote in May 2014, about App.net as I saw things at the time.

[Here's a link to the podcast](http://bazbt3.10centuries.org/2017/03/05/i-lost-the-plot-adn) - hosted at the excellent [10centuries.org.](http://10centuries.org/)

Incidentally, the show number is a guess.
