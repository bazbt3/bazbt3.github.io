title: Obsolete

I just finished making dinner for me and the girls and realised something quite profound.  [My web site](http://bt3.com) has existed in various forms and at various hosts over the 20 years since I arrived online.  That's not the important thing, no.  2017 is the first year that events outside my control rendered the vast majority of its content obsolete.

Yes, this is another post about the collateral damage resulting from App.net's demise; though this one will thankfully be brief.  Being honest, I don't see much point in writing much about the past now, the future is much more *important.*  It's actually very easy for me to say that; the majority of people who made App.net special are at 10centuries.org or pnut.io right now.  A nicely-distributed 'ADN2'. [http://adn2.larryanderson.org](http://adn2.larryanderson.org)

Back to my Wiki-type site.  First the volunteer-driven App.net Wiki I helped edit expired, I stepped away from iOS, and *then* the network the App.net Wiki documented disappeared.  Well, at least its infrastructure did.  Ahhhâ€¦

My focus changed over the last year-and-a-half to blogging about what I'm thinking about, what I'm doing, and what makes me tick.  A typical personal blog.

Maybe I should redirect incoming site requests to my [10C blog.](http://bazbt3.10centuries.org) or the more complete but less-social [GitHub.com version](http://bazbt3.github.io) or, heck, the [trial self-hosted blog](http://git.bt3.com) currently unloved and waiting for me to reconnect the Raspberry Pi 2 B mirroring it from the [GitHub repo.](https://github.com/bazbt3/bazbt3.github.io)

Dunno.
