I hold a healthy amount of respect for our local Conservative councillors: approachable, local people; all with local interests at heart.  All turn out to community-organised events.  If not pillars of our community then friends of it, with a deep understanding of what makes it tick.

At a national level though, Conservatives seem completely, irredeemably, incompetent.  If not morally-bankrupt, they're providing us with a useful template, a solid foundation for future generations to build misery on.

Speaking of foolish people, my life tends to run along a series of streaks.  'Cold Toilet Seat' and 'Blogging' are just 2 I could mention.  Here's a good one though:

Days I haven't made a complete arse of myself: 0.

It reset today.
