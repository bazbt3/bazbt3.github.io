Drunk neat with it and me at room temperature: oh yes.  Looking forward to dropping an ice cube in the next, because I know what I like.

Smells just ok, but it's eminently drinkable.

The bottle looks good, its contents are immediately accessible, most unlike the trials and tribulations of fighting my way into the over-designed Maker's Mark bottle.  It both handles and pours well and pulling the cork seems positively luxurious in comparison.

To be continuedâ€¦
