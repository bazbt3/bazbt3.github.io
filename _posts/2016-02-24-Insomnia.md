I've been asleep, honest!  Knowing there would be a solution to my Raspberry Pi automation woes I started to search around 2am.

Google and Stackoverflow.com are pretty handy at this time of night; 'rvm installation not working: "RVM is not a function".

It turns out that all I needed to obviate my need to run the scripts in a login shell was to copy the second line of code from `~/.bash_profile` to `~/.bashrc`.

Thankyou Haris Krajina!

No, I'm *not* going to wait up.
