title: Mothering Sunday
---

This Mothering Sunday (aka Mothers Day) we went to church - it was the Brownies' and Ladybirds' Flag parades too.

I thought about my dear departed mum and the sacrifices she and dad made to keep us comfortable and to support me until I started to work…

During the service the choir sang Psalm 127, and the temporary vicar asked us, with a smile, to follow along too - if we could.

Yeah, it's *impossible* without choral training and a safety net, so I simply traced the words with my index finger.  I was lucky that I could *read* the words; I'd taken my reading glasses along this time!

So, here it is, **Psalm 127, from the King James Version:**

> 1 Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
> 
> 2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
> 
> 3 Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.
> 
> 4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.
> 
> 5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.

I occasionally have dark thoughts about the results of *my* quivering arrows, but overall, in a non-spiritual sense, I've been blessed by my 2 girls.

The thing is, I don't really  care if I've misinterpreted the Psalm; I took something *good* away from it.
