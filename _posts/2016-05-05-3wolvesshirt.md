title: '3 Wolves Shirt'
---

Last week I ordered a shirt.   Not just any shirt, but a shirt of power, a shirt of mystical significance, a shirt to spark and fulfil dreams. It arrived last Thursday, the shirt I blogged about last week did.  Yes.

So far:

* Even before it arrived, we got new neighbours,
* The shirt arrived,
* Thursday's takeaway dinner arrived 1/2 hour early,
* Paid for by my wife,
* It was lovely,
* My wife's been looking sideways at me every time I wear it,
* And sniggering.

(As I start this post I am wearing the shirt; this sniggering, it's not a normal day here!)

Um…

Not much else to report really.

The shirt size, it runs a little large.  This 'Large' is a bit baggy, feels a bit like I'm wearing a dress.  A large, purple, tie-dyed dress with a front bearing an artistic design depicting 3 Wolves howling at the moon.

Um…

Tomorrow, as they say, is another day.  I'd promised to wear it the shirt at work last Friday; it's dress-down on Fridays.

I could not.

It's not large, purple, tie-dyed with a front bearing 3 Wolves howling at the moon dress-down Friday.

I've an open mind, no-one would comment unfavourably, would they.

I've an open mind.

Ohhh no I haven't!

Maybe I should wash the thing, maybe its magic is activated somehow by the action of water, washing powder and agitation.

Hmmm…

And if it shrinks in the wash, hey…
