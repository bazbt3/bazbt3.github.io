Today marks the ninth anniversary of the sale of our first home together, my wife, my first daughter, and me.  A precarious few months preceded the joy of signing that piece of paper and terminating the first of our two mortgages together.

Two concurrent mortgages, though in no way unique, stretched us nonetheless.  The simple fact is that we picked a budget for how new home and exceeded that by a generous two-digit percentage.

And we're *still* paying for that decision.

Still, it is good that I've not been shot at, for at *least* nine years and three months.
