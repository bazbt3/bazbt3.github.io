title: Snow

It snowed in Rochdale today, and Rochdale ground to a near-halt.  My drive to work, a journey that normally takes around 20 minutes, took 2 hours!

It happens every winter, *every* time it snows.

The utterly clueless idiots-behind-their-wheels appear to make my desire for a 4-wheel-drive car a near-irrelevance.

'Near' isn't total; that'll do for me.
