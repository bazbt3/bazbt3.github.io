We have an office custom; on or around one's birthday one brings along cakes, pastries, biscuits or even better (depending on the significance of the number) and shares with immediate colleagues & all-and-sundry.  I'm no different; this year I bought 1kg of shortbread biscuits and placed then at the allotted, erâ€¦ place.

3 hours after arrival they've nearly all gone.  I got it right.  It feels good.

Thanks to those who wished me a happy birthday, even though my rationale for not bringing stuff in on the day sounded a bit lame.  At least the Amazon Prime Now explanation went down well (see yesterday's 'Order' post) - as did the biscuits.

Now, those who just take and walk off are bad enough.  There's nothing worse though than someone inquiring whose birthday it is, then walking either away or *past* one's desk.  Eating a biscuit!
