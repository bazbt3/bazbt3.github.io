I was wrong.  The 139th [White House Easter Egg Roll event went ahead with the Trumps in attendance.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2017/04/17/21000-people-and-18000-eggs-the-trump-white-house-braces-for-its-first-easter-egg-roll/)  I guess I'm simply not in tune with a lifestyle which allows separate taxpayer-funded flights for the President and the First Lady, from Washington DC and New York City, to Florida for a couple of days.  And then back again.

Some people will point at this one event, ignore the history and the numbers, and assume the world is returning to normal.  Hey, the First Lady *might* have organised and supervised the planning of the Egg Roll.

Others will watch the following video and groan:

Or read this article and groan:

You know, I *am* enjoying reading stuff from The Washington Post.  It makes a nice change from, erâ€¦
