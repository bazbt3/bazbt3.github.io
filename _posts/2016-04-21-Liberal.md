Cake.  Pies.  Pizza.  Good wishesâ€¦  Every time we have a birthday at work we colleagues get the benefit of the celebrant's largesse; it's great.

Yesterday's and today's celebrations put my recent kilogramme of biscuits to shame: yesterday 3 large pre-sliced cakes; today pies, pizza, chicken nuggets, other foodstuffs, *and* the remains of yesterday's cakes!

At the 10am daily brew time I chanced an arm - being Queen Elizabeth II's 90th birthday it seemed appropriate to alert the birthday boy thus: "Brew time ma'am!"  I curtseyed too.  Badly though, I'm out of practice.

It was received well.

I found a personal limit yesterday; 9 pieces of cake, sized small as they were, is indeed too much.

Perhaps I should have used the title 'plentiful', a good couple of days.
