We attended the church Remembrance Day service earlier then walked along to the War Memorial where the village congregated for the open-air service.  In church, the Last Post was followed by 'Jerusalem' and the hymns were rounded out by 'Abide With Me'.

The last time I heard the Last Post was, well, the previous years' services and at a great Uncle's funeral service.  He'd fought in Burma during WWII, was a member of the Burma Star organisation, had a *significant* number of compatriots along in his last day.

So yeah, I LOL'd this time as well as *that*.

No, wait, no; the thing with tears and a swelling of the breast.  Yeah, that thing.
