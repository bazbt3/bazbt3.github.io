title: 'Maker''s Mark review part 6'
---

Drunk neat at room temperature or with ice: oh, no.

Maker's Mark Bourbon Whiskey smells amazing whether it's newly-poured into my favourite glass, or it's the remains evaporated overnight and sniffed during the tidy-up the following morning.  (No, I've absolutely no idea why I did it the first time!)

But, after the initial welcome the taste becomes unpleasant to me.  No Baz's seal of approval here I'm afraid.

There's a tad more to whiskey than a pleasant aroma, even my limited experience tells me that.  The 2 preceding brands were pleasant, unchallenging.  This, if it's an American favourite, seems analogous to the way I feel about Hershey's chocolate: it's to-me-unfathomably popular, explainable away by a blind obedience to the cult of historic nationhood, but there's no getting away from its' smelling, as it does, of sick.  

Concluded early.
