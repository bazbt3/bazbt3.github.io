Apologies for my absence from everywhere social for the last week. I haz bean programin stuf!!!2!ยก

The 2 shell scripts to take my GitHub blog repo and throw it up at my Web host now work.  Automagically.  I'm ***amazed!***

Next step: think of something to write, post it at GitHub, and see if I'm full of hot air or not.

Currently the most recent post at [git.bt3.com](http://git.bt3.com/) is 'Engineer', which is preceded by 'Nerdity'.

Midnight UK time should prove something - *this* post should be up round about that time.
