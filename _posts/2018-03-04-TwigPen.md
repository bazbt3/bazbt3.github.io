I'm just about to turn off the IFTTT trigger that tweets notification of my blog posts to Twitter.  I've written a wrapper for Python's 'Twython' module; one that provides auth and, right now, the ability to post a tweet.  Fingers crossed, hoping it seamlessly replaces IFTTT.

It's called [TwigPen](https://github.com/bazbt3/TwigPen), a name borrowed from my pnut.io social network app [PigPen](https://github.com/bazbt3/PigPen).  It's used like this from within a Python script:

`import TwigPen`

`…some code to define tweettext…`

`TwigPen.postsomething(tweettext)`
