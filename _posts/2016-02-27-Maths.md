Not maths as such, more precisely **pseudomaths**:

endhour == 23    
starthour == 7    
uploadpayload == 24    
dayspermonth == 30

bandwidthused == (( endhour - starthour ) - 1 ) * uploadpayload * dayspermonth

bandwidthused = Oopsie!

Miscalculating the amount of data I was uploading to my web host would have totalled 6 times my monthly bandwidth allowance.  As it happens it was lucky I caught it early; the 24MB included an early version of the entire folder contents I *expected* to upload - off by three times my expectation!

Felling silly.

Fixed?  Well, I temporarily stopped the uploads prior to changing the routine to run every 3 hours - which may still exceed the allocation but I'm betting onâ€¦

I hope I can figure out how to transfer only *changes* to my site repo.  I'll really need to closely monitor my sh\*t.
