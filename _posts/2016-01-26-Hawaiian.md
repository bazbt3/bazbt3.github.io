### \*\* Newsflash!! \*\*

**Dateline: Right now!**

We have a simply *great* work custom: anyone having a birthday brings in food and shares it with all.  Today, 4rthur\* (thanks 4nne\* for cooking & laying it all out) brought a particularly rich spread, pizzas, cake, pork pies, some, er… tasty things…

I just ate a couple of slices of a Hawaiian pizza.

(pause for effect…)

And ***again*** I liked it.

To recap; if you read my recent 'Pineapple' post, you'll see I introduced a foodstuff (pineapple) positioned diametrically opposite to my views on the addition of fruit to savoury meals.  

I'm not averse to [foodstuffs prepared in challenging ways](https://github.com/bazbt3/recipes/blob/master/Sandwiches/Bazwich.md) but pineapple is one of those polarising fruits; tolerable in isolation, downright *wrong* on a pizza.  Or with gammon.\*\*

Or so I *thought.* 

My palate must be changing with age; after all I eschewed the pepperoni pizza, picking up the Hawaiian in preference.

It would appear that 2016 is *indeed* a year of experimentation, compromise… If only my attitudes to *other* deeply entrenched beliefs could be moderated in a similar fashion.

Perhaps I need to go around licking stuff - you know, to test if my attitudes can be modified according to taste?
