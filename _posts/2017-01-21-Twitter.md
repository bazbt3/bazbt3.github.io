title: 'Twitter diminishes'
---

I'm scaling back my involvement on Twitter (in addition to a recent step away from Facebook.)  It'll mean a more casual attitude to my timeline: no more devotion to reading *all* the tweets, no more politically-charged retweets, no desire to keep up with and research the background behind the very latest news.  In short I need a break, a chance to examine what I want.

So what will I do with the time usually filled waiting for the relief I'm currently finding when there are no more posts remaining to read? 

* Read books,
* Write better blog posts,
* Create more stuff at GitHub,
* Watch films,
* Make my girls do their homework on time,
* Erâ€¦

Oh yes, this:
