title: '80s bands again'
---

A headline: ["Seven bands from the 80s we wish would reunite"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39692931) *(BBC Entertainment & Arts)*

A paragraph: "Children of the 1980s, rejoice - the original Bananarama line-up is back together at last. Which got us thinking - lots of 80s bands have reformed over recent years but which ones are we still wishing would reunite?"

A suggestion: [Talking Heads.](http://louderthanwar.com/talking-heads-reform/) (Note the article date before exploding.)

I can but hope.
