title: 'Bands seen live'
---

There's a list, varying with each person, going round social media at the moment.  It challenges friends, readers, to pick a lie from a list of 10 bands supposedly seen live by the poster.

Here's mine, though live music's never been my 'thing' for a lot of reasons:

* The Cheeky Girls
* The Mitchell Brothers
* Bob Geldof
* Deacon Blue
* The Prodigy
* Buck's Fizz (tribute)
* Girls Aloud
* 50 Cent
* Speedway
* erâ€¦ I can only think of nine.

So there you go, consider yourself challenged to find the lie!
