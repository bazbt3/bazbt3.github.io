A mish-mash of themes follows; it's been a while since my last confes, er… blog post.

Um… Python programming is addictive. If I could use it at work to do engineering I'd be even happier!

Now:

Started last October, m second-ever Python script: [**PigPen**](https://github.com/bazbt3/PigPen), a social networking app for the [https://pnut.io](https://pnut.io) social network,  Mainly feature-complete where features exist; apart from those that don't work. A mentions or messages alert companion application would be a good thing to write, sometime.

[**Crypto**](https://github.com/bazbt3/crypto), a cryptocurrency notification and alert application, designed to send regular, timed messages over the Pushover system. Now with added 3-graph goodness of the previous 24 hours' movements! Currently also sends messages to my dev channel at pnut.io, but it currently seems a little pointless.

[**rssupdatepnut**](https://github.com/bazbt3/rssupdatepnut), periodically checks an RSS feed (currently my blog, but it could be a news feed) for updates, which it should eventually post to pnut.io and other networks. Designed to run periodically. Incidentally, the publication of this post will be its first live test!

The future:

I've set myself a few *professional* goals for this year. Yes, 2018.

* My maths skills have atrophied; I'd like to be re-updated to engineering college ONC level by December. A project would be good, to inject a bit of real-world reality into the proceedings.

* Organisation and working 'smart': I've adopted the [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com) logging and diary system. With a bit of luck it'll help end my indecision and tendency to bury stuff. One of its strengths is the 'Migration', where incomplete tasks are pushed forwards during the weekly and monthly reviews.

Personal goals too!

* Reliability would be great!

* I missed February's pnut.io [\#ThemeMonday](https://pnut.io/tags/ThemeMonday). Sorry all, it's been an odd, kind-of crappy start to the year.

Other:

* I nearly blogged about my recent longest-ever poo, an epic of 35 minutes I'll never see again; and the effort in pre-flush preparation, I…
