A potentially contentious post follows.

If you've been buying (or have been bought) Heinz Tomato Ketchup all your life, then let me tell you, you're doing life wrong.

Try Tesco Tomato Ketchup instead. It tastes more tomato-ey, less vinegary, it's got a better texture than its frankly artificial-tasting competitor and, the best bit, it's approaching half the price!

[Which? Magazine's blind taste tests](http://www.which.co.uk/news/2011/05/supermarket-tomato-ketchups-topple-heinz--253327/) (login required to read the full article)Â and my discerning palate can't be wrong.

Go on, give it a try, what's the worst that could happen?
