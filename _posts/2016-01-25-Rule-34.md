title: Rule 34
---

Yesterday I created and posted (if that's the correct term) my first podcast.  (It at least looks and *sounds* like one.)

Today, whilst I was sat at my desk, a colleague approached andâ€¦ "48 seconds" he said.

Despite the fact he'd earlier mentioned listening to the audio, and alluded to the (unfortunately fictional) [Chorley FM slogan](http://phoenixnights.wikia.com/wiki/Chorley_FM) "Coming in your ears", my expression must have conveyed my abject lack of understanding.

He proceeded to explain, **"[REDACTED]"**

"Ah," I replied.  Take a look at this.

But it's not really appropriate to search too deeply for a definition of [Internet Rule 34](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_34_(Internet_meme))\* on a work PC, is it.
