Not much to say today apart from to mention the local flooding (thankfully not hyperlocal, i.e. not right *here.*)

The power was off for 1-1/2 hours this morning, the centre of Rochdale flooded as the River Roch burst its banks, and at the sewage works.  Bury had a gas explosion, and a pub collapsed not far northâ€¦

My wife, working tonight, left her phone here.  She had a couple of diversions en-route, so I'm hopeful it's an easy drive home in the morning.

It's still bloody raining!
