There's no doubt in my mind that I'm no longer the invincible fourteen year old my sense of self has identified with for the past few decades.  I had the first inkling over 11 years ago, simply waking then walking downstairs.  This latest indication that I must re-evaluate 'me' though, it simply shouldn't have happened.

Crushing plastic bottles to fit more into the recycling bin is something I have an unnatural pride in.  Start from the neck, flatten going down the sides, fold over the base, throw into the IKEA 'Sortera' box.  Yesterday evening though, I felt a twinge in my left thumb, but carried on regardless.  Perhaps being fortified by a glass of 'Buffalo Trace' Kentucky whiskey emboldened me to simply work through the mild discomfort?

This morning though, in the cold light of day (well dark, it's not even dawn here yet) I find myself needing a painkiller or two.

Getting old(er) Baz.
