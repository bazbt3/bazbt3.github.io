## The TrumpTon:

*n*: Statements which whilst devoid of substantial content are designed to instil confidence in the speaker's abilities but which, when analysed even trivially, indicate an intent to deprive the listener of previous hard-fought gains.

*example usage*:

> '"I think Brexit is going to be a wonderful thing for your country,” he said. “I think when it irons out, you're going to have your own identity, and you are going to have the people that you want in your country and be able to make free trade deals without having somebody watching you and what you are doing."'

*example detriment to listener*: Extended periods of austerity and employment losses.  Racism.  Bigotry.  Xenophobia.  Large corporations assuming a foothold in foreign health markets previously out-of-bounds by statute, thus extracting obscenely opportunistic profits from business opportunities to the detriment of large swathes of the population.  Zero independent oversight.
