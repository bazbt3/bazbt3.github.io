What idiot would design a nurses uniform to make it more stylish, form-fitting, and ignore the fact that 2 separate machune temperature cycles are required to wash it effectivelyâ€½

Honestly, the rank stupidity of those in charge of big organisations never fails to surprise me.

How difficult can it be to choose one material that's hard-wearing, washes in one load?  Like the scrubs my wife *used* to get.

Maybe there's a metaphor screaming to be let out here.
