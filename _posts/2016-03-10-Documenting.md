I decided early to add comments to the code I'm putting together for my early-alpha application for the [10Centuries.org](http://10centuries.org) social network.

I've now also begun to document the install and first run, the basic usage of the application, and spent more time cataloguing and resolving security, usability and efficiency issues.

In addition to a sense of directed purpose it's surprisingly absorbing.

Take a look here:

I still have 10Centuries invites available, if you're interested in clearing out *your* social networking cobwebs.  The site's web interface *kills* my thing, easily!

Conversations tbere are heading healthily away from discussing the network and towards real-life stuff.

Does anyone like coffee?
