Right now I feel as if I've melted.  I've been drinking wine; half a bottle of a rather nice Merlot.  It's a 'Turner Road' or 'Turner's Road' or something, my vision's a bit blurry now too.  I must also apologise in advance if this post makes more sense than the usual...

I say it's a 'rather nice' wine but, to be honest, it's not an objective statement based on what *other people* think, it's simply one I *like.*  Don't get me wrong, I read reviews of red wines, Scottish single malt whiskies, preground coffees for my AeroPress, cars, computers, USB drives, NASs, dog and cat toys, TV stands... and occasionally even *buy* stuff rather than indulging myself with procrastination.

Other folks' opinions are of course important to me, but I'm my own man.  I was my own man even as a boy.  Family life is attempting to beat *that* out of me; resistance is futile...

I spent quite some time choosing mt prefect whisky: a Laphroaig 15-year-old; first tasted on a cruise down the River Nile, now available only as a special edition, far beyond my budget.  If I had a big birthday coming up I could perhaps flutter my eyelashes in the hope someone'd buy me one.  But even I shudder at *that* prospect despite my innate sense that' I'd be worth it.

So, this Merlot has achieved something a few hours of productive coding this weekend failed to.  A sense of achievement.

No, I don't understand either.
