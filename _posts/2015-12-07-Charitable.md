How do you explain to someone, without actually *explaining*, that you will not buy their raffle tickets (all proceeds to local charities, prizes donated by local businesses) because you already gave *more than* your allocation for the month?

Not an easy few words.

So I kept my few words to an absolute minimum, and yet *still* experienced a sense of guilt.  It probably doesn't matter that I already gave to one of the beneficiary charities a few weeks agoâ€¦

Are we programmed to donate socially, judged unfairly when we don't?

Probably.  And probably.

I always *have* picked 'my' charities to suit my history, circumstances and mood.  And occasionally because my friends or acquaintances believe passionately-enough to mention them.  Or in response to media-led frenzies.  It's a perfect storm when all three influences coincide.

Yeah, because I'm only human.
