During winter the darker hours bring out the worst in people.  I'm not talking about death, mayhem, increased criminality; it's a simple as a disregard for child and personal safety.

Every morning I've been seeing see cyclists ride along busy roads, black clothing, black bags, black bikes.  Even on the wrong side of the road.  Lights?  None.  Adults don't seem to care, and children...  Well, *surely* parents and schoolteachers should be monitoring departures and arrivals?

There's a phrase.  Most don't seem to know what it means, don't seem to care:

> **"Personal resonsibility"**    
> *noun*,    
> *modern, ambitious, ambiguous*:    
> **1.** An overwhelming reliance on state initiatives to promote a sense of wellbeing in self.

Yesterday evening around 5pm, as I was driving home, I spotted a young man walking past a high hedge above a low wall.  That is I *eventually* spotted him; his clothing (*not* camo) hid him *very* effectively.  Though visibility was reduced by that time of day, by no means everyone had side- or headlights on...

And don't get me started on drivers of black cars - overwhelmingly the most common group to avoid side- and headlights entirely,  Is it a part of the mindset involved in the purchasing decision?

Modern LED car sidelights are annoying too.  Daytime running lights at the front, but absent entirely from the rear, bypass common sense entirely.  Drivers get in the car safe in the knowledge that people in front can see them...

A stealth, [Darwin-Awards-winning](http://www.darwinawards.com/rules/) society, that's what we have.
