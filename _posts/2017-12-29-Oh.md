Two rather expensive days, emotionally *and* financially:

`£130 - Loki cat to vet:`
`       Suspected congestive heart failure`
`£ 30 - Loki cat followup:`
`       Heart problem confirmed, not acute`
`£612 - 4 new tyres + tracking:`
`       Highlighted by just-about reaching the vet`
`£327 - Ruby overnight vet visit:`
`       Who ate 1/4 pack of Smarties and the chocolate off a Crunchie bar? (Chocolate: poisonous to dogs.)`
