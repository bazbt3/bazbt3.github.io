title: 'In Betweeners'
---

Elaborating on (or maybe not, it's not my place to say) my 'Between' post yesterday, @matigo provided some [nicely written (as-ever) insights into a modern curse.](http://jason.10centuries.org/2016/04/02/in-between).

'Curse' is my cruel trick; a word, a hook to drag you in.  Oops!

Social burnout.

Most here will have a social networking networking history, may even identify personally with Jason's words…  For me it's a case of 'the wrong time of year'.

For you…?

Choice.  While I had only IRC and MS Chat, that's all I used. IRC was a one-day thing for me; i can't recall *any* actual interactions at all.  Literally one day.  I got online and, within the first month explored every protocol and service available to me as a new Microsoft Network (MSN) customer.

Incidentally, I forgot to mention ICQ in my blog post; a service I used mainly to connect to people I *already knew* online.  In real time.  Mine was, probably still is, a 6-digit user ID.

Nowadays though we've dozens of places we can go to express ourselves.  There are social networks, forums, niche services…  There we can chat about our desires, hopes, dreams… with other like-minded people, hopefully without troublemakers intervening.  Most of us want a quiet life when we want a quiet life.

Yes, that.

So, App.net (ADN); it's a place with lots of good memories, good people, but it's been let down by its founders and those in search of a bigger audience.

Now mine's not a massive criticism.  I'm hardly there at all, my feeling's more one of a remembrance of the emotional baggage stemming from the SOTN post, the frankly-ridiculous antagonism (I'll never understand why people don't simply block) and the network's inevitable subsequent decline.

And guilt.

I'm not doing #QuoteSunday (always a low-engagement thing) in part due to IFTTT's ADN support shutting down, nor am I running #ThemeMonday (once an entirely different proposition.)

That reminds me, I should really move the #ThemeMonday page at my site and replace it with… Sometime.

I must examine my other social network profiles linking to ADN, to see whether I must move them to where I'm most comfortable calling my social hub.

Or must I?

A perhaps-telling FYI; Last year, despite others not doing, I upgraded my ADN account to 'Developer'.  More of a statement of intent, a gesture, an attempt to pay back in…  I developed nothing of course but got a vague sense of wellbeing, and a hammer to add to my bio.  THIS year I downgraded.  To an 'ordinary' paid user account.  Not all the way to '40'.

Hollow.

But here I am at 10C, with a Premium account paid-up until 2017 (over the top of Jason's invite) developing an 'app' for 10C. How odd.

So, back to the blog post. Burnout maybe, but I'm happy to call 10centuries.org (10C) home.

One thing to bear in mind; I'm crap at publicising stuff; hence the *one* successful invite. Kinda successful, I'm hoping the guy I invited will spend a bit more time at 10C…

And that others will follow.   There's nothing to lose.  No ads, no spam.  Really. 

And here be (more) Adventures! Maybe.
