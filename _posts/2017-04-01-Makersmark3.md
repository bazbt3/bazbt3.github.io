title: 'Maker''s Mark review part 3'
---

I bowed to popular demand\* and wrote what follows about the third Bourbon Whiskey I've ever tried.  Well, the fourth bottle of the stuff.  My first experience was 2 consecutive bottles of Buffalo Trace, then one of Wild Turkey 101 and, as the subject line indicates, I'm now trialling Maker's Mark.

Ahhh, what a day *that* was…

No, no!  It takes over a week per bottle, honestly!  Jeez!

First though, my earlier post:

> "Drunk with a single ice cube with me at room temperature: oh.
Smells amazing.
To be continued…"

From the guy who recommended it, the comment that precipitated this, an unprecedented same-day update:

> "Enough about the smell. Do you like the taste? That was my favourite favourite."

Well…

No.  Not yet.

It's rather nice to start with but there's an aftertaste which comes on quickly that I'll admit I'm not liking.  It spans my first neat test, and today's single ice cube (just-melted.) Buffalo Trace seems to have a cleaner finish; Wild Turkey 101, though a bit too strongly alcoholic at 50.5% for me, seems to lack this unpleasant fall-off too.  All pull back my gums and attack my lips to a greater or lesser extent, which is rather nice, *if* I let them.

No, I haven't a bloody clue what I'm talking about, especially if I'm using anything like understandable terminology, but I know what I like.  Bear in mind that I've been drinking Scotch whisky for over 20 years, off-and-on, culminating in the utterly awesome Laphroaig 15-year-old, a whisky now withdrawn from general sale and thus prohibitively expensive.  Incidentally, the 10 year old is a good substitute but don't make the mistake I did of trying the 'Select', it's completely unrepresentative of the fine brand.

Ok, the hardest bit about this experience so far is not admitting that I'm not too keen on the whiskey someone I trust recommended, nor is it the effort in typing right now not long after reaching the bottom of the second glass.  No, it's getting through the melted plastic covering the Maker's Mark bottle cap.  The pull-tab is utterly unsuitable for its intended purpose, so much so that I almost had to get the Swiss Army Knife out!  It *looks* nice but I get the impression it took quite some time to design it to make it look as though it's an organic continuation of a product of a bygone age.  Heck, it might be but I'm not sufficiently invested in it to find out.

However…

To be continued…

\*Yes, you.
