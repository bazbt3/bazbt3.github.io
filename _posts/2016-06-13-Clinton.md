Do you, like I, recall a time a decade or two ago; a time when Mr Clinton was accused of being a bit of a thicky, driven to succeed by the efforts of his much cleverer wife - Mrs Clinton - who most commentators of the day positioned as the brains of the outfit?

Isn't it strange how men and women are now disowning her, with the simple accusation that she would NEVER have reached 'here' by herself.

How odd.

I shouldn't dabble in political commentary, I can't seem to understand the basics.
