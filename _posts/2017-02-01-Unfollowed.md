And then, in one smooth operation, I unfollowed all my Twitter political accountsâ€¦ Which was nice.

Really, I know there's no avoiding politics now, but I have my limits.

So, a prelude to stepping away from Twitter *and* eventually Facebook, and spending more time at 10Centuries (with [some coding](https://github.com/bazbt3/10cbazbt3) on the cards.)

And yes, dabbling in [pnut.io](https://pnut.io) too.
