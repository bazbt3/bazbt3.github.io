I've eaten too much over the last few days.  For most in the western, developed world it's an obvious thing to do at this time of year.  Eat to excess, buy to excess, etc.

Me though; I haven't put weight on for years.  I've tended to *lose* it instead.  In that respect too I'm atypical.

2015 was a year of a small but consistent weight loss for me - started during #Movember 2014 and helped along by more fruit & veg, fewer slices of bread.

There's a week to go until I go back to work.  Hopefully in that time normality will be restored.
