title: 'Four Roses whiskey'
---

Attempting to find a better Bourbon whiskey than 'Buffalo Trace' I've been asking around, and received what really do sound like good recommendations.  For now though I'm bypassing Irish whiskeys (Bushmills Black Bush) in favour of the authentic Kentucky stuff.

Despite my long-winded, ultimately negative review of 'Maker's Mark' I really enjoyed the experience; it's not often I step outside my comfort zone and have the luxury of being able to analyse it at my leisure.

Ok, I've had one from each of the 3 groups in [this Ask Men article.](http://uk.askmen.com/fine_living/wine_dine_archive_300/384_bourbon-cheat-sheet.html)  The old Turner palate favoured one from the 'high rye' group so what's where I'm heading again.  Thanks to whoever suggested the 'Woodford Reserve' but it's unavailable here this evening on Amazon Prime Now.

Somewhere between 10pm and midnight today the doorbell will ring and my delivery of Four Roses Single Barrel whiskey, and cat food, will be handed over.  After, that is, I prove that I'm an adult by scrawling my digital signature on the deliverer's phone.

Ahhhâ€¦ convenience.
