We're all searching for some kind of meaning in life, right?

Here's a dialogue extract taken from my all-time-favourite movie 'Armageddon'.  It's during a scene the night before the team blast off to attempt to save mankind from an approaching killer asteroid.  Its a love scene of sorts:

> Grace Stamper: "Baby, do you think its possible that there's someone doing this very same thing at this very same time?"

> A.J.: "I hope so, otherwise, what the hell are we trying to save?"

If you haven't seen the film yet, or dismissed it out-of-hand based on its frankly unrepresentative [Rotten Tomatoes score](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/armageddon/), please, have a go; it will change your life.  Really.

Heh!  Perhaps not, but it's great entertainment.  And if you find it resonates with your take on what's happening with this world of ours right now, so much the better.
