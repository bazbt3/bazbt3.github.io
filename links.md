### Mine:

* Though I'm currently running two in parallel, my *real* blog is at [blog.bt3.com.](http://blog.bt3.com) (Don't worry about the redirect to re-app.net, that's the actual hosting service's URL.
* I have a [Github.com profile](https://github.com/bazbt3) with a few repositories of my own creation and a couple of [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/bazbt3).
* I'm unnaturally pleased with the work I've done for the volunteer-created and driven [App.net Wiki](http://appdotnetwiki.net/)
* My [test site](http://www.bt3.com) - bt3.com, a domain I've owned since 1997!

### App.net:

* [ThemeMonday](/thememonday/) - a simple premise; a group of like-minded App.net people change their avatars monthly to a chosen theme.

---

### Others':

* **Blogging:** Jason Irwin's [10Centuries.com](http://10centuries.com/) - my *real* blog host.
* **Coding:** [ericdke's](https://github.com/ericdke) [Ayadn] (https://github.com/ericdke/na) App.net command line client. (My ['ayadn_shell'](https://github.com/bazbt3/ayadn_shell) repo's shell script menu ran over it, might still.)
* **Eating:** [Edward Vielmetti's](https://github.com/vielmetti) [sandwich repo](https://github.com/vielmetti/sandwich) became the inspiration for my [recipes](https://github.com/bazbt3/recipes) repo.

---

### Meta:

* This blog uses the [poole/hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) repo as its base.
* The [App.net Comments Widget](http://blog.app.net/2014/02/13/what-is-the-app-net-comments-widget/) used on pages & posts is by @voidfiles on App.net.
