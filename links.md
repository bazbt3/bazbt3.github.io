## A page of links

### Me, mine:

* I'm [@bazbt3](http://app.net/bazbt3) at the App.net social network.
* [My main blog](http://bazbt3.re-app.net/) - hosted at 10 Centuries.
* I have a [Github.com profile](https://github.com/bazbt3) with a few repositories of my own creation and a couple of [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/bazbt3).
* I'm unnaturally pleased with the work I've done for the volunteer-created and driven [App.net Wiki](http://appdotnetwiki.net/)
* My [test site](http://www.bt3.com) - bt3.com, a domain I've owned since 1997!

### Others':

* **Blogging:** Jason Irwin's [10Centuries.com](http://10centuries.com/) - my *real* blog host.
* **Coding:** [ericdke's](https://github.com/ericdke) [Ayadn] (https://github.com/ericdke/na) App.net command line client. (My ['ayadn_shell'] (https://github.com/bazbt3/ayadn_shell) repo's shell script menu ran over it, might still.)
* **Eating:** [Edward Vielmetti's](https://github.com/vielmetti) [sandwich repo](https://github.com/vielmetti/sandwich) became the inspiration for my [recipes](https://github.com/bazbt3/recipes) repo.


### Meta:

* This blog uses the [poole/hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) repo as its base.
