### Mine:

* Though I'm running two in parallel, my *real* blog is at [blog.bt3.com.](http://blog.bt3.com) (Don't worry about the redirect to 10Centuries.org, that's the actual hosting service's URL.
* I have a [Github.com profile](https://github.com/bazbt3) with a few repositories of my own creation.
* My [test site](http://www.bt3.com) - bt3.com, a domain I've owned since 1997!
