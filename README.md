This uses the [poole/hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) repo as its base.

1. I didn't stand a cat in hell's chance of doing this myself, I simply don't currently have the skills or desire to code to this level.
2. I don't intend to spend *much* time fiddling here, but it's an interesting idea.

See [README.md](https://github.com/poole/hyde/blob/master/README.md) (the original) for more technical details.
