## A simple blog, done in a complex manner.

### What:

This uses the [poole/hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) repo as its base.

1. I didn't stand a cat in hell's chance of doing this myself, I simply don't currently have the skills or desire to code to this level.
2. I don't intend to spend much time fiddling here, but it's an interesting idea. For more, see my test blog at **[bazbt3.github.io.](http://bazbt3.github.io/)**

---

### Todo:

- [ ] Create an 'Everything else' section linking to .md files within a /pages/ folder.
- [ ] Update 'Apple' icon image to my personal avatar.
- [ ] Create an automatic archive generator page.

---

See [README.md](https://github.com/poole/hyde/blob/master/README.md) (the original) for more technical details.
