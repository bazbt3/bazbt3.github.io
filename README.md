## A simple blog, done in a complex manner.

### This uses the [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repo as its base.

1. I didn't stand a cat in hell's chance of doing this myself, I simply don't currently have the skills or desire to code to this level.
2. I don't intend to spend much time fiddling here, but it's an interesting idea. For more, see my test blog at **[bazbt3.github.io.](http://bazbt3.github.io/)**

See [README.md](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/blob/master/README.md) (the original) for more.
