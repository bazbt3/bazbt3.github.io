### Me:

A simple\* man with a wonderful wife, 2 daughters. Alpha male to Loki cat, Mollie cat's food provider, Ruby dog's poop scooper. Asks silly questions.

INTJ (hid well.)

I'm [@bazbt3](https://alpha.app.net/bazbt3) on the App.net social network.

Though I'm currently running two in parallel, my *real* blog is at [blog.bt3.com.](http://blog.bt3.com) (Don't worry about the redirect to re-app.net, that's the actual hosting service - see the [Links](/links/) page for more.)
